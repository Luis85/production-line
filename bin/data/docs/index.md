# The Forge documentation

The Forge is a terminal project companion for AI-assisted project and product development. The user works in Obsidian; the agent uses this CLI to create, edit and verify the same vault from the terminal. The [product vision](explanation/product-vision.md) explains the goals. Start with the task you need to complete. These docs follow [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/): tutorials teach through a concrete exercise, how-to guides solve a task, references define exact contracts, and explanations describe the reasoning behind the design.

## Tutorials — learn by doing

For first-time users and agents learning the workflow. Follow each tutorial in order; each has a concrete outcome.

| Tutorial | What you will build |
| --- | --- |
| [Getting started](tutorials/getting-started.md) | A workspace, managed project and safely created planning note |
| [Your first Markdown-defined UI](tutorials/first-ui.md) | A reusable surface component and composed dashboard generated from Markdown |
| [An interactive form](tutorials/interactive-form.md) | Component state, reusable event/action definitions and browser behavior |
| [From idea to production](tutorials/idea-to-production.md) | A worked path through discovery, requirements, design, implementation, testing and production readiness |

The [idea-to-production example pack](examples/idea-to-production/README.md) supplies editable stage artifacts, prompts and component definitions used by the longer tutorial.

## How-to guides — complete a task

For users who already know their goal. Each guide states the needed context and gives the relevant commands.

## Explanation — understand the design

For contributors and teams deciding how to use The Forge within their architecture.

- [Product vision](explanation/product-vision.md): the terminal project companion, the two interfaces to one vault, the knowledge graph, core plugins and the roadmap.
- [Architecture and boundaries](explanation/architecture.md): domain/application ports, storage ownership, project scope and extension lifecycle.
- [Deterministic UI generation](explanation/deterministic-ui.md): why definitions are declarative, what reproducibility means, and where application code begins.
- [Current agent-first polishing review](https://github.com/Luis85/agent-cli/blob/main/src/the-forge/docs/research/12-agent-first-polish-review.md): current workflow findings, resolved gaps, research and verification evidence; maintainer material hosted in the repository.
- [Historical product review](explanation/product-review.md): the 2026-10-07 findings and verification limits, some superseded by later work.

Repository contributors should also read `AGENTS.md` and the [development guide](how-to/develop-and-test.md). Agent operators can use the [Forge workflow skill](../../skills/forge-workflow/SKILL.md), [development skill](../../skills/forge-development/SKILL.md), [webview prototyping skill](../../skills/forge-webviews/SKILL.md), [browser evidence skill](../../skills/forge-browser/SKILL.md), [file-editing skill](../../skills/forge-vault/SKILL.md), [agent definitions skill](../../skills/forge-agents/SKILL.md) and [backlog skill](../../skills/forge-backlog/SKILL.md); [install them](how-to/install-agent-skills.md) into `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills`.
