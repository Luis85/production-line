# Error catalog

[Documentation](../index.md) · Reference

Every built-in failure has a stable `code` from this catalog. The catalog is the single source of exit statuses, categories, retryability and recovery hints. `node bin/forge.js schema --json` lists it at `data.errors` as `{code, exitCode, category, retryable, summary}`, so agents can discover it from the installed executable. A test fails when Forge source throws a code missing here, or when a catalogued code is no longer thrown.

## Failure envelope

```json
{"ok":false,"error":{"code":"NO_MATCH","message":"The find text does not occur in the file. Read it again and copy the exact current text.","hint":"Read the file again and copy the exact current text into --find, including whitespace and line endings.","retryable":false,"details":{"find":"Draft","matches":0}},"events":[],"warnings":[]}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `code` | Stable machine identifier. Match on it, never on `message` |
| `message` | The original diagnostic in English, or the translated summary with `--lang de` |
| `hint` | The next step to take. Present for every catalogued code |
| `retryable` | `true` when repeating the unchanged invocation later can succeed. The catalog gives each code's default; an occurrence may override it, as `WORKSPACE_BUSY` does with `false` for a lock whose holder Forge cannot verify. Built-in `WORKSPACE_BUSY`, `SERVER_BUSY` and `SERVER_STOP_FAILED` may be retryable; inspect lifecycle state with `server status` before repeating a failed stop |
| `details` | Optional structured data, documented per code below |

Plugins can register their own codes with a category, summary, hint and retryability (see [plugin error codes](plugins.md#strings-and-error-codes)); `schema` lists them after the built-in codes with their `plugin`, and their failures carry `hint` and `retryable` like built-in ones. Other plugin-defined codes keep their own shape, without `hint` or `retryable`. A code thrown by plugin code maps only when that plugin registered it, a provider of a service it declared registered it, or it is a built-in code ([code ownership](plugins.md#strings-and-error-codes)); any other plugin's code, like any thrown value that is not a Forge error, becomes `OPERATION_FAILED`. With `--lang de`, `message` and `hint` are German, `code`, `retryable` and `details` stay unchanged, and the original diagnostic moves to `details.localization.originalMessage`. See [CLI language](language.md).

## Exit statuses

| Category | Exit | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| success | 0 | `ok:true` |
| `runtime` | 1 | Unexpected runtime, I/O or plugin failure |
| `external` | 1 | Claude Code could not run or failed |
| `input` | 2 | Invalid arguments, definitions or edit requests |
| `conflict` | 2 | The target exists or changed since it was read |
| `not-found` | 3 | A file, project or selected project is missing |
| `busy` | 4 | Another Forge writer holds the workspace lock, or another command holds the server lifecycle lock |
| `drift` | 5 | Generated UI, data-source or workflow output differs from its sources |
| `interrupted` | 130 | Claude Code was interrupted by SIGINT; SIGTERM reports 143 |

## Recovering edits and guarded writes

**`NO_MATCH`** (exit 2): the `edit --find` text does not occur in the file. `details` is `{find, matches: 0}`. Read the file again, because it may have changed, and copy the exact current text, including whitespace and line endings. Nothing was written.

**`AMBIGUOUS_EDIT`** (exit 2): the `--find` text occurs more than once, counting overlapping occurrences. `details.matches` is the total count, and `details.lines` lists the 1-based line of each match start, at most 20. Add surrounding text until the match is unique. Nothing was written. An empty `--find` fails with `INVALID_INPUT`.

**`SECTION_NOT_FOUND`** (exit 2): `edit --section` names no heading, or `edit --block` no block. For a section, `details` is `{section, headings}`, where `headings` lists up to 50 headings of the note as `{section, line}` with the full heading path and its 1-based line; for a block it is `{block, blocks}` with the note's block ids in document order. With `--section-line` (or `sectionLine`), no heading the path matches starts on that line: `details` adds `line`, and `headings` lists the headings the path matches. Copy an existing path, line or id. Nothing was written.

**`AMBIGUOUS_SECTION`** (exit 2): the heading path matches several headings, for example `Risks` under both `Plan` and `Notes`. `details` is `{section, matches, candidates}` with each candidate's full path and line; add an ancestor heading (`Plan > Risks`) until one remains, or pass a candidate's `line` as `--section-line` (`sectionLine` in an `apply` plan); headings with the same full path differ only by line, and the message then suggests only that. A `--block` id that occurs on several blocks reports `{block, matches}`: Obsidian links only the first, so give each block a unique id. Nothing was written.

**Multi-edits and plans**: an `edit --edits` list fails with the code of its failing replacement (`NO_MATCH`, `AMBIGUOUS_EDIT`) and adds `details.edit`, the 0-based position of that replacement; the message starts with `Edit <n>:`. A failing `apply` plan operation keeps its own code and details and adds `details.operation`, the 0-based position of the operation, and its message starts with `Operation <n> (<op>):`. Schema violations of a plan fail with `INVALID_PLAN` and `details.issues` (`plan.operations[<n>].<field>: <problem>`); an invalid `--edits` list fails with `INVALID_INPUT` and the same `issues`. In every case nothing was written.

**`CONFLICT`** (exit 2): the `--if-match` revision does not match the stored file, or a write would replace a file without its revision. Dry runs report the same conflict as the real write. `details` is:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | The first conflicting path, relative to `context.root` |
| `expectedRevision` | The revision the request supplied, or `null` when it supplied none |
| `currentRevision` | The stored file's revision, or `null` when the file does not exist |
| `conflicts` | Multi-file batches only: `{path, expectedRevision, currentRevision}` for every conflicting path |

`currentRevision` equals what a fresh `read` returns. Do not resend the old request with that revision unchanged: read the file, reapply the change to its current content, then retry through the command's revision guard: `--if-match` for file commands, or a reviewed `--plan-out` plan and `--revisions-from` for generation. `create` has no guard and only adds new paths; replace an existing file with `write --if-match`. `write`, `edit`, `properties`, `patch`, `create` over an existing file and native Claude settings updates report these details; an `apply` plan reports them for the operation in `details.operation`, both when an operation's `ifMatch` is stale and when a file changed between planning and committing. Generation commands such as `make ui` keep the details and replace the message with planning guidance.

**`WORKSPACE_BUSY`** (exit 4, retryable while the holder runs): see the [write contract](cli.md#write-contract) for `details.lock`, `details.stale` and `details.path`. A lock whose holder provably no longer runs is broken automatically with a warning, so this error means the holder runs or another running writer is removing the stale lock (`stale: "active"`, `retryable: true`), the holder cannot be verified (`stale: "unknown"`, `retryable: false`: check the holder, then delete the file in `details.path`), or the holder provably no longer runs but this writer's own removal failed (`stale: "stale"`, `retryable: false`: confirm no Forge process uses it, then delete the file in `details.path`). A live `backlog sync` holds `.forge/sync/<connection>.lock` at the workspace root for its whole run, whichever scope syncs; the message names the lock file, and `details.lock.command` is `backlog sync`.

## Recovering moves and deletions

**`HAS_BACKLINKS`** (exit 2): `delete` found files outside the deleted path that link into it. `details.backlinks` lists each link as `{source, target, kind, line, original}`: `kind` is `link`, `embed`, `frontmatter` or `canvas`, `line` is the 1-based line of a body link and `null` otherwise, and frontmatter and Canvas links add the property `key` or Canvas `node`. Dry runs refuse the same way. Rewrite the links (or `move` the file, which rewrites them), or pass `--allow-broken-links` to delete anyway; the result then lists them in `data.brokenLinks`.

**`DESTINATION_EXISTS`** (exit 2): `move` or `rename` never replaces an existing file or folder. `details` is `{path, from}`. Choose another destination, or move or delete the existing entry first. A rename that only changes letter case is allowed, including on case-insensitive filesystems.

**`PROTECTED_PATH`** (exit 2): `move` and `delete` refuse the scope's `.obsidian` and `.forge` folders and `bin` at workspace scope, in any letter case (`details` names the `path` and the `protected` root), and folders that contain a `.git` repository. `delete --permanent` also refuses folders that contain symlinks, `node_modules` folders or other special files (`details` names the `path` and up to 20 such `entries`); move them to the trash instead. `.git` itself and the scope root are invalid paths (`INVALID_PATH`).

**`INVALID_MOVE`** (exit 2): the destination equals the source, lies inside the moved folder, or a `rename` name contains `/`.

A stale `--if-match` for the moved or deleted path, or a referring file that changed while links were planned, fails with `CONFLICT`; reread with `read` (files) or `delete --dry-run`/`move --dry-run` and retry.

## Codes

| Code | Exit | Category | Retryable | Summary | Hint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SERVER_START_FAILED` | 1 | runtime | no | The localhost server could not start. | Check the requested port and installed server bundle, then retry server start. |
| `SERVER_STOP_FAILED` | 1 | runtime | yes | The verified localhost server could not stop. | Run server status, then retry server stop. |
| `SERVER_STATE_INVALID` | 2 | conflict | no | The saved localhost server state is invalid or unsafe. | Inspect `.forge/server.json` and its parent directory; do not stop an unverified process. |
| `SERVER_BUSY` | 4 | busy | yes | Another command is changing the localhost server state. | Wait for the other server command to finish, then retry. |
| `UNKNOWN_COMMAND` | 2 | input | no | The command is not registered. | Run help or schema to list available commands, including enabled plugin commands. |
| `UNKNOWN_OPTION` | 2 | input | no | The option is not accepted by this command. | Run `help <command>` to list its options. |
| `MISSING_ARGUMENT` | 2 | input | no | A required argument or option value is missing. | Correct the arguments named in the message; run `help <command>` for usage. |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | 2 | input | no | The arguments or option values are invalid for this command. | Correct the arguments named in the message; run `help <command>` for usage. |
| `INVALID_OPTION_VALUE` | 2 | input | no | The option value, or an item of a comma-separated list option, is not one of the values the command declares. | Use one of `error.details.allowed`, or for a list option several of them separated by commas; `help <command>` lists each option's values. |
| `DUPLICATE_OPTION` | 2 | input | no | An option was repeated or combined with its negation. | Pass each option once. |
| `INVALID_INPUT` | 2 | input | no | The input options are invalid or contradictory. | Use exactly one input source and the option combination named in the message. |
| `INPUT_REQUIRED` | 2 | input | no | `--stdin` was requested without piped input. | Pipe the content into the command, or use `--content` or `--from` instead. |
| `INVALID_JSON` | 2 | input | no | The input is not valid JSON. | Pass a valid JSON value; quote it for your shell. |
| `INVALID_ENCODING` | 2 | input | no | The content is not valid in the required encoding. | Use valid UTF-8 text. For binary content use `write` or `create` with `--stdin`, `--from` or `--encoding base64`; `edit` and structured commands accept only UTF-8 text. |
| `INVALID_LANGUAGE` | 2 | input | no | The language is not supported. | Use `--lang` en or `--lang` de. |
| `INVALID_NAME` | 2 | input | no | The name does not follow the required naming rule. | Use the name format described in the message, for example PascalCase. |
| `INVALID_KEY` | 2 | input | no | The property key is reserved or unsafe. | Use a different property key. |
| `INVALID_RESULT` | 1 | runtime | no | The command returned data that cannot be serialized as JSON. | Inspect committed vault events and reread affected files before retrying; report the failing plugin command. |
| `OPERATION_FAILED` | 1 | runtime | no | An unexpected runtime or I/O error occurred. | Read the message, check the workspace state and reread affected files before retrying. |
| `INVALID_PATH` | 2 | input | no | The path is not a valid workspace-relative path. | Use a relative path inside the selected workspace or project, with forward slashes and no `..` segments. |
| `UNSAFE_PATH` | 2 | input | no | The path leaves the workspace or crosses a symbolic link. | Use a path inside the workspace that does not traverse symbolic links. |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 3 | not-found | no | The file or resource does not exist. | Check the path and the selected project (project current); run list to find files. |
| `CONFLICT` | 2 | conflict | no | The file already exists or its revision changed since it was read. | Reread the file and reconcile your change with the current content (`error.details.currentRevision`), then retry with the command's revision guard (`--if-match` or `--revisions-from`); `create` only adds new paths. |
| `NO_MATCH` | 2 | input | no | The `--find` text does not occur in the file. | Read the file again and copy the exact current text into `--find`, including whitespace and line endings. |
| `AMBIGUOUS_EDIT` | 2 | input | no | The `--find` text occurs more than once, counting overlapping matches. | Extend `--find` with surrounding text so it matches exactly once; `error.details.lines` lists the matching lines. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_EDIT` | 2 | input | no | This edit is not supported for the file kind. | Use edit for Markdown and text, properties for frontmatter, patch for Canvas and Bases, and write for attachments. |
| `SECTION_NOT_FOUND` | 2 | input | no | No heading matches the `--section` path, or no block has the `--block` id. | Read the note and copy a heading path from `error.details.headings` (segments joined with " > ") or a block id from `error.details.blocks`. |
| `AMBIGUOUS_SECTION` | 2 | input | no | The `--section` path matches several headings, or the `--block` id occurs more than once. | Add ancestor headings to the path (Parent > Heading) until one of `error.details.candidates` remains, or pass a candidate's line as `--section-line` (`sectionLine` in an apply plan); give each block a unique id. |
| `INVALID_PLAN` | 2 | input | no | The apply plan or write batch is invalid: it does not match the plan schema, or its steps have duplicate or overlapping paths. | Fix the operation named in `error.details.operation` (see `error.details.issues` and the plan schema in help apply); write each path once and do not reuse a path that the same plan moves or deletes. |
| `WORKSPACE_BUSY` | 4 | busy | yes | Another Forge writer holds the workspace lock or a backlog sync lock. | `error.details.stale` says why the lock stays (a lock whose holder provably no longer runs is removed automatically with a warning). `"active"`: the holder runs, or another running writer is removing the stale lock; wait and retry. `"unknown"`: Forge cannot verify the holder (another host, pid namespace or boot, or an unreadable lock), so `error.retryable` is false; confirm in `error.details.lock` that it no longer runs, inspect its unfinished changes, then delete the file named in `error.details.path` (relative to the workspace root) and retry. `"stale"`: the holder provably no longer runs but removing the lock failed, so `error.retryable` is false; confirm no Forge process uses it, then delete that file and retry. |
| `DESTINATION_EXISTS` | 2 | conflict | no | The move or rename destination already exists. | Choose a destination that does not exist (`error.details.path`), or move or delete the existing file first; Forge never overwrites a destination. |
| `PROTECTED_PATH` | 2 | input | no | The path is protected from moves and deletion. | Forge never moves or deletes `.obsidian`, `.forge` or, at workspace scope, `bin` (in any letter case), nor a folder holding a `.git` repository; it permanently deletes only folders without symlinks, `node_modules` or special files, so move such a folder to the trash instead. The scope root and `.git` paths are refused as `INVALID_PATH`. |
| `INVALID_MOVE` | 2 | input | no | The move or rename is not possible. | Use a destination that differs from the source and is not inside it; rename takes a new name without slashes. |
| `HAS_BACKLINKS` | 2 | conflict | no | Other notes still link to the file or folder. | Update or remove the links in `error.details.backlinks` first, move the file instead, or pass `--allow-broken-links` to delete anyway. |
| `ROLLBACK_FAILED` | 1 | runtime | no | A failed write could not restore every file. | Inspect the files named in the message and repair them before retrying. |
| `INVALID_FRONTMATTER` | 2 | input | no | The YAML frontmatter is invalid. | Fix the frontmatter so it is a YAML mapping, then validate the note. |
| `INVALID_YAML` | 2 | input | no | The YAML document is invalid. | Fix the YAML syntax, keys or aliases named in the message. |
| `INVALID_CANVAS` | 2 | input | no | The Canvas structure is invalid. | Fix the nodes, edges or ids named in the message; run `validate <file.canvas>`. |
| `INVALID_BASE` | 2 | input | no | The Base structure is invalid. | Fix the Base definition named in the message; run `validate <file.base>`. |
| `INVALID_POINTER` | 2 | input | no | The JSON Pointer is invalid or does not address a valid location. | Read the document and use an existing pointer path; `/-` appends only to an existing array. |
| `INVALID_BASE_QUERY` | 2 | input | no | The Bases query is invalid. | Check the view, context and expressions named in the message. |
| `INVALID_BASE_EXPRESSION` | 2 | input | no | A Bases expression cannot be parsed. | Fix the expression named in the message. |
| `BASE_EVALUATION_ERROR` | 2 | input | no | A Bases expression failed while evaluating a file. | Check the view, file and expression named in the message. |
| `BASE_VIEW_NOT_FOUND` | 2 | input | no | The requested Bases view does not exist. | Run `bases inspect <file.base>` and pass an existing `--view`. |
| `BASE_CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND` | 2 | input | no | The context file is not an indexed vault file. | Pass an existing vault file to `--context`. |
| `INVALID_BASE_PROPERTY_TYPES` | 2 | input | no | The Obsidian property type registry is invalid. | Fix `.obsidian/types.json` so it is a JSON object of property types. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_BASE_PROPERTY_TYPE` | 2 | input | no | An Obsidian property type is not supported. | Use a supported type in `.obsidian/types.json`. |
| `INVALID_CONFIG` | 2 | input | no | The configuration is invalid or unreadable. | Fix `bin/config.json` at the location named in the message, then run config. |
| `INVALID_SETUP` | 2 | input | no | Setup cannot complete with the current distribution files. | Repair the bin path named in the message, then run setup again. |
| `INVALID_PROJECT` | 2 | input | no | The project metadata is invalid. | Fix `.forge/project.json` in the project directory. |
| `INVALID_PROJECT_NAME` | 2 | input | no | The project name is invalid. | Use a lowercase kebab-case name, for example billing-service. |
| `INVALID_PROJECT_CONTEXT` | 2 | input | no | The saved project selection is invalid. | Run `project open <name>` or project close. |
| `INVALID_COMPONENT_KIND` | 2 | input | no | The component kind is invalid. | Use domain or application. |
| `PROJECT_EXISTS` | 2 | conflict | no | The project already exists. | Choose another name or run `project open <name>`. |
| `PROJECT_NOT_FOUND` | 3 | not-found | no | The project does not exist. | Run project list and open an existing project. |
| `PROJECT_REQUIRED` | 2 | input | no | This command needs a selected project. | Run `project open <name>` first. |
| `STALE_PROJECT_CONTEXT` | 3 | not-found | no | The selected project is missing or no longer matches the configuration. | Run `project open <name>` to select a valid project, or project close. |
| `INVALID_TEMPLATE` | 2 | input | no | The Markdown template is invalid. | Fix the template frontmatter or placeholders named in the message. |
| `INVALID_TEMPLATE_DATE` | 2 | input | no | A template date or date format is invalid. | Use an ISO date and a supported date format. |
| `INVALID_TEMPLATE_PACK` | 2 | input | no | The template pack is invalid. | Use unique template ids and destinations. |
| `INVALID_TEMPLATE_VALUES` | 2 | input | no | Template values are missing or have the wrong type. | Run `templates inspect <template.md>` and supply its required values. |
| `UNKNOWN_TEMPLATE_VARIABLE` | 2 | input | no | The template uses an undeclared variable. | Declare the variable in the template or remove the placeholder; run `templates inspect <template.md>`. |
| `UNKNOWN_GENERATOR` | 2 | input | no | The generator is not registered. | Run make to list generators. |
| `INVALID_GENERATION_PLAN` | 2 | input | no | The generation plan has overlapping outputs or invalid options. | Use separate output and manifest paths, and do not combine planning with `--revisions-from`. |
| `INVALID_GENERATION_REVISIONS` | 2 | input | no | The revision approval does not match the reviewed plan. | Create a new plan with `--plan-out` and pass that file to `--revisions-from`. |
| `UI_DRIFT` | 5 | drift | no | Generated UI files are missing or differ from their definitions. | Run the same command with `--plan` to review, then regenerate. |
| `DATA_SOURCE_DRIFT` | 5 | drift | no | Generated data-source files are missing or differ from their definitions. | Run the same command with `--plan` to review, then regenerate. |
| `GENERATION_DRIFT` | 5 | drift | no | Generated files are missing or differ from what the generator produces. | Run the same make command with `--plan` to review, then regenerate. |
| `INVALID_WORKFLOW` | 2 | input | no | An authored project workflow is invalid or two workflows generate the same file. | Fix or rename the workflow under `src/infrastructure/workflows/<concern>/` named in the message, then run `workflows sync`. |
| `WORKFLOW_DRIFT` | 5 | drift | no | Generated GitHub workflows are missing, changed or stale. | Run `workflows sync`, review the changes in `.github/workflows` and commit them with their sources. |
| `INVALID_UI` | 2 | input | no | A component definition is invalid. | Fix the definition named in the message; run components validate. |
| `INVALID_UI_LIBRARY` | 2 | input | no | The component library is invalid. | Run components validate and fix the reported definitions. |
| `INVALID_UI_FRAMEWORK` | 2 | input | no | The UI target is not supported. | Use html, htmx, vanilla, vue, svelte, react or angular. |
| `EMPTY_UI_LIBRARY` | 2 | input | no | The component library has no definitions. | Run components init or add a Markdown definition. |
| `DUPLICATE_UI_COMPONENT` | 2 | input | no | Two component definitions share an id. | Give each component a unique id. |
| `UNKNOWN_UI_COMPONENT` | 2 | input | no | The component is not defined. | Run components list and use an existing id. |
| `CYCLIC_UI_COMPONENT` | 2 | input | no | Component references form a cycle. | Remove the cyclic reference named in the message. |
| `UI_RENDERER_UNAVAILABLE` | 2 | input | no | No renderer is available for this UI target. | Choose a supported `--framework`. |
| `INVALID_INTERACTION` | 2 | input | no | An interaction definition is invalid. | Fix the event, actions or bindings named in the message; run interactions validate. |
| `DUPLICATE_INTERACTION` | 2 | input | no | Two interaction definitions share an id. | Give each interaction a unique id. |
| `EMPTY_INTERACTION_LIBRARY` | 2 | input | no | The interaction library has no definitions. | Run interactions init or add a Markdown definition. |
| `UNKNOWN_INTERACTION` | 2 | input | no | The interaction is not defined. | Run interactions list and check the component's interaction references. |
| `INVALID_DATA_SOURCE` | 2 | input | no | A data-source definition is invalid. | Fix the fields named in the message; run data-sources validate. |
| `DUPLICATE_DATA_SOURCE` | 2 | input | no | Two data-source definitions share an id. | Give each data source a unique id. |
| `EMPTY_DATA_SOURCE_LIBRARY` | 2 | input | no | The data-source library has no definitions. | Run data-sources init or add a Markdown definition. |
| `UNKNOWN_DATA_SOURCE` | 2 | input | no | The data source is not defined. | Run data-sources list and use an existing id. |
| `DATA_SOURCE_RENDERER_UNAVAILABLE` | 2 | input | no | No generator is available for this data source. | Use a supported data-source kind; run help make for data-source generation. |
| `INVALID_PLUGIN` | 2 | input | no | A plugin manifest or implementation is invalid. | Fix the plugin named in the message, or disable it with `--no-plugins`. |
| `INVALID_PLUGIN_CONFIG` | 2 | input | no | The plugin configuration is invalid. | List unique lowercase kebab-case ids of installed user plugins in `plugins.enabled` in `bin/config.json`; run plugins to list them. |
| `INCOMPATIBLE_PLUGIN` | 2 | input | no | The plugin requires a newer Forge version. | Update The Forge or disable the plugin. |
| `DUPLICATE_PLUGIN` | 2 | input | no | The plugin is registered twice. | Enable each plugin once. |
| `PLUGIN_NAMESPACE` | 2 | input | no | A plugin id or contribution is outside its namespace. | Prefix user plugin command, generator, skill and event ids, and the service ids of every plugin, with the plugin id and a dot and error codes with its id in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE; do not use a host event namespace (`command`, `operation`, `vault`, `metadataCache`, `workspace`, `plugin`) as the plugin id or claim `core: true` outside the bundle, and do not declare the options `make` owns (`out`, `plan`, `plan-out`, `check`, `revisions-from`) on a generator. |
| `PLUGIN_SERVICE_MISSING` | 2 | input | no | A plugin needs a required or optional service that no enabled, available plugin provides, or uses one it did not declare. | Enable the plugin that provides the service named in `error.details.service` and make it available (plugins lists providers and states), or declare the service in the plugin's `requires` or `optional`. |
| `PLUGIN_UNAVAILABLE` | 2 | input | no | The command or generator belongs to, or needs a service of, a plugin that is disabled, missing or unavailable. | `error.details.reason` says why: fix the `plugins.settings` problems listed in `error.details.issues` in `bin/config.json`, enable the disabled provider it names (remove it from `plugins.disabled`), or install the missing provider in `bin/plugins`, then rerun. Run `plugins` to see each plugin's state and reason. |
| `PLUGIN_SERVICE_CYCLE` | 2 | input | no | Plugin service requirements form a cycle. | Break the cycle named in `error.details.plugins` so that one plugin no longer requires a service of another. |
| `PLUGIN_LIFECYCLE` | 2 | input | no | A plugin used the host outside its lifecycle. | Register contributions before activation and stop using the host after disposal. |
| `DUPLICATE_OR_INVALID_ID` | 2 | input | no | A contribution id is invalid or already registered. | Use a unique lowercase dotted id. |
| `UNKNOWN_SKILL` | 2 | input | no | The skill is not registered. | Run skills list. |
| `INVALID_EVENT` | 2 | input | no | An event definition or event state is invalid. | Define events with a dotted id and validator before disposal. |
| `INVALID_EVENT_LISTENER` | 2 | input | no | An event listener is not a function. | Pass a function as the listener. |
| `INVALID_EVENT_PAYLOAD` | 2 | input | no | The event payload does not match its contract. | Run events and emit a payload that matches the contract. |
| `DUPLICATE_EVENT` | 2 | input | no | The event id is already registered. | Use a unique event id. |
| `UNKNOWN_EVENT` | 2 | input | no | The event is not registered. | Run events to list registered event ids. |
| `EVENT_RECURSION` | 2 | input | no | Event handlers recursed too deeply. | Stop handlers from emitting the events that trigger them. |
| `EVENT_OWNERSHIP` | 2 | input | no | A plugin tried to emit an event it does not own. | Emit only events in your plugin's own namespace; host events (`vault.*`, `metadataCache.*`, `workspace.*`, `operation.*`, `command.*`, `plugin.*`) are emitted by the host and another plugin's events by that plugin. |
| `INVALID_CLAUDE_AGENT` | 2 | input | no | The Claude agent definition is invalid. | Fix the field named in the message, then rerun the command. |
| `INVALID_CLAUDE_HOOKS` | 2 | input | no | The Claude hook configuration is invalid. | Fix the field named in the message, then rerun the command. |
| `INVALID_CLAUDE_PLUGIN` | 2 | input | no | The Claude plugin manifest or a plugin file is invalid. | Fix the field named in the message, then rerun the command. |
| `INVALID_CLAUDE_SETTINGS` | 2 | input | no | The Claude settings file is invalid. | Fix the JSON structure of the settings file named in the message. When it names the generation manifest `.claude/forge-generated.json`, an older Forge wrote it: delete `.claude/forge-generated.json` and run `agents generate` again; the rules it listed stay in `.claude/settings.json` until you remove them. |
| `INVALID_CLAUDE_COMMAND` | 2 | input | no | The Claude command is not supported. | Run claude capabilities. |
| `INVALID_CLAUDE_ARGUMENT` | 2 | input | no | A Claude command argument is invalid. | Correct the arguments named in the message; run `help <command>` for usage. |
| `INVALID_CLAUDE_OPTION` | 2 | input | no | The option is not allowed for this Claude command. | Run help claude and remove the option. |
| `INVALID_CLAUDE_SCOPE` | 2 | input | no | The Claude scope is invalid. | Run help claude and pass a `--scope` value supported by that action. |
| `INVALID_CLAUDE_INPUT` | 2 | input | no | The Claude input is invalid or too large. | Pass valid input within the size limit. |
| `INVALID_CLAUDE_OUTPUT` | 2 | input | no | The Claude output format is invalid. | Use text, json or json-last-line. |
| `INVALID_CLAUDE_OUTPUT_LIMIT` | 2 | input | no | The Claude output limit is invalid. | Use a positive integer number of bytes. |
| `INVALID_CLAUDE_TIMEOUT` | 2 | input | no | The Claude timeout is invalid. | Pass the timeout in milliseconds within the range named in the message. |
| `INVALID_CLAUDE_EXECUTABLE` | 2 | input | no | The Claude executable path is invalid. | Pass an executable path to `--claude-bin`. |
| `CLAUDE_NOT_INSTALLED` | 1 | external | no | The Claude Code executable was not found. | Install Claude Code and put claude on PATH, or pass `--claude-bin`. |
| `CLAUDE_WORKING_DIRECTORY_UNAVAILABLE` | 1 | external | no | The Claude working directory is unavailable. | Check that the selected project or workspace root exists and is a directory. |
| `CLAUDE_COMMAND_FAILED` | 1 | external | no | Claude Code could not be started or stopped unexpectedly. | Read error.details, inspect external state, then retry deliberately. |
| `CLAUDE_COMMAND_TIMEOUT` | 1 | external | no | The Claude command exceeded its timeout. | Inspect external state; retry with a larger `--timeout` only if the work did not complete. |
| `CLAUDE_OUTPUT_LIMIT` | 1 | external | no | Claude output exceeded the size limit. | Inspect external state; retry with a larger output limit only if needed. |
| `CLAUDE_COMMAND_INTERRUPTED` | 130 | interrupted | no | The Claude command was interrupted by a signal (exit 130 for SIGINT, 143 for SIGTERM). | Inspect external state before running the command again. |
| `CLAUDE_RUNTIME_FAILED` | 1 | external | no | Claude Code exited with a nonzero status. | Inspect error.details (native status, output and parsed result) and external state before retrying. |
| `CLAUDE_INVALID_OUTPUT` | 1 | external | no | Claude Code succeeded but did not return the requested JSON. | Inspect stdout and external state before retrying. |

## Core plugin codes

Bundled [core plugins](plugins.md#core-and-user-plugins) register their own codes like any plugin: `schema` lists them with their `plugin`, they carry `hint` and `retryable`, and `--lang de` localizes them. They exist only while the plugin is enabled.

| Code | Plugin | Exit | Category | Retryable | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `WEBVIEW_INVALID` | `webviews` | 2 | input | no | The built view fails manifest or static-asset validation, or changes an installed asset between a file and a directory. Inspect `dist` and its matching project-ID manifest; use regular supported assets and a new path for file/directory changes; see [webviews](webviews.md) |
| `WEBVIEW_BUILD_REQUIRED` | `webviews` | 2 | input | no | The selected webview project has no build output. Run `npm run build` in that project, then `webview inspect` before publication |
| `WEBVIEW_DRIFT` | `webviews` | 5 | drift | no | `webview publish --check` found differences between `dist` and the installed view. Inspect the comparison and publish the reviewed build; replacing changed installed output requires its folder revision with `--if-match` |
| `BROWSER_UNAVAILABLE` | `browser` | 1 | runtime | no | The browser runtime or executable is unavailable. Run `browser status`, then `browser install`, or supply an installed Chromium executable with `--browser-executable`; see [browser](browser.md) |
| `BROWSER_CAPTURE_FAILED` | `browser` | 1 | runtime | no | The webpage could not be captured. Check the URL, browser availability, readiness selector and timeout; no screenshot was written |
| `BROWSER_INSTALL_FAILED` | `browser` | 1 | external | no | Managed Chromium installation failed. Check network access and disk permissions, then retry `browser install` or use `--browser-executable` |
| `BROWSER_FLOW_INVALID` | `browser` | 2 | input | no | The declared tutorial source, action, locator or output path is invalid. Run `browser validate` and correct the diagnostic before execution |
| `BROWSER_FLOW_FAILED` | `browser` | 1 | runtime | no | A tutorial could not complete. Inspect the failing step and actual website state before retrying; existing tutorial files were preserved, but prior browser actions may already have affected the site |
| `UPDATE_DOWNLOAD_FAILED` | `updates` | 1 | external | no | GitHub release retrieval or extraction failed. Check network access, curl, tar and disk space; app files were preserved |
| `UPDATE_INVALID` | `updates` | 2 | input | no | Stable release version, checksum, archive or distribution manifest is invalid. Inspect the release before retrying; see [app updates](updates.md) |
| `UPDATE_SCOPE_INVALID` | `updates` | 2 | input | no | The target workspace has no installed Forge distribution. Install a release first or correct `--root` |
| `INVALID_SEARCH_PATTERN` | `search` | 2 | input | no | The pattern is empty, longer than 1,000 characters, or an invalid regular expression. Fix the expression named in the message, or search literally without `--regex`; see [search](search.md#errors) |
| `SEARCH_TIMEOUT` | `search` | 2 | input | no | Matching exceeded `plugins.settings.search.timeoutMs`; `details.timeoutMs` names the budget. Simplify the expression, narrow `--path` or `--kind`, or raise the budget; see [regular-expression safety](search.md#regular-expression-safety) |
| `VAULT_CHECK_FAILED` | `vault-check` | 2 | input | no | `vault check --strict` found at least one finding of severity `error`. `details` holds `summary` (`files`, `findings`, `error`, `warning`, `info`), `rules` (`id`, `severity`, `findings`), the first 100 error `findings` and `truncated`. Fix each finding by its `hint` and run the check again; without `--strict` findings never fail; see [vault checks](vault.md) |
| `INVALID_AGENT_DEFINITION` | `agents` | 2 | input | no | A definition fails docker-agent schema or semantic validation, an `agents create`/`import` would leave its file invalid, generated agent or skill names collide, or `--settings` would write a broad allow rule without `--allow-broad-permissions` (`broad-permission`). Fix each diagnostic in `details.files[].diagnostics` (or `details.diagnostics`), which names a JSON `pointer`, `line` and `column`; see [agents](agents.md#diagnostics) |
| `AGENT_NOT_FOUND` | `agents` | 3 | not-found | no | `agents inspect <file>#<agent>` or `agents generate --agent` names an agent no definition defines; `details.agents` lists a file's agents. Run `agents list` |
| `AGENT_EXISTS` | `agents` | 2 | conflict | no | `agents create` or `agents import` names an agent the target file already defines. Choose another name or file |
| `AGENT_MERGE_CONFLICT` | `agents` | 2 | conflict | no | `agents generate` would replace an MCP server in `.mcp.json` or the `agent` of `.claude/settings.json` that Forge did not write (`details.diagnostics` with `mcp-server-conflict` or `settings-agent-conflict`). Rename the server in the definition, pass `--rename-conflicts` with `--mcp project`, or remove the entry; Forge replaces only entries recorded in `.claude/forge-generated.json`; see [generation](agents.md#generation) |
| `AGENT_DRIFT` | `agents` | 5 | drift | no | `agents generate --check` found generated Claude files that are `missing`, `changed`, `hand-edited` or `stale` (`details.outputs`, `details.stale`). Review with `--plan-out`, then regenerate with `--revisions-from`; see [generation](agents.md#generation) |
| `BACKLOG_NOT_FOUND` | `backlog` | 3 | not-found | no | No `product-backlog` view in the scope, the `--base`/`--view` does not exist, or the item is not in the backlog. Run `backlog init`, pass `--base` and `--view`, or check `backlog list`; see [backlog](backlog.md#choosing-the-backlog) |
| `BACKLOG_AMBIGUOUS` | `backlog` | 2 | input | no | Several backlog views or items match; `details.candidates` lists them. Pass `--base`/`--view` or a vault path |
| `BACKLOG_CONFIG_PROBLEM` | `backlog` | 2 | input | no | Two roles share one property key, the base has no `product-release` view, or a release option the action needs is unbound; `details` names the problems or options. Fix the `.base` view options |
| `BACKLOG_WRITE_REFUSED` | `backlog` | 2 | conflict | no | The plugin's rules refuse the write; `details.reason` names the rule (`outside-filter`, `field-not-held`, `not-a-release`, `dependency-cycle`, `unbound-property`, …); see [refusals](backlog.md#refusals-and-the-write-gate) |
| `BACKLOG_NO_GAP` | `backlog` | 2 | conflict | no | No rank is free between the neighbours of a move; `details.reason` is `tied`, `gapSpent`, `unranked` or `unseededList`. Run `backlog ranks respace` (or `seed`) and move again |
| `SYNC_CONFLICT` | `backlog` | 2 | conflict | yes | The remote item changed between reading and writing it (its revision moved), or its links changed on the other end while an update changed them (then its `parent` and `dependencies` are reported as conflicts by the next sync wherever the sides differ). `backlog sync resolve` fails with it; `backlog sync` reports it per note in `failed` and continues. Run `backlog sync status` and repeat; see [sync](backlog.md#sync-with-external-trackers) |
| `SYNC_INTERRUPTED` | `backlog` | 130 | interrupted | no | SIGINT or SIGTERM stopped a live `backlog sync` at a safe point, before its next remote write or vault commit (exit 130, or 143 for SIGTERM); `details.signal` names it. Its locks are released and every remote item it created is recorded in the sync state. Run `backlog sync` again to finish; a second signal terminates at once, and the next sync then recovers the lock |
| `CONNECTOR_NOT_FOUND` | `connector` | 3 | not-found | no | No connection with that id in `plugins.settings.connector.connections` (`details.connections` lists them), or its platform has no enabled connector (`details.platforms`). See [connectors](connectors.md) |
| `CONNECTION_INVALID` | `connector` | 2 | input | no | A connection profile fails its platform schema or names unknown mapping fields; `details.issues` names each path |
| `CONNECTOR_AUTH_FAILED` | `connector` | 1 | external | no | The token variable named in `details.tokenEnv` is unset, or the service refused it (`details.status` 401, 403, 203 or a sign-in redirect). Set the variable to a valid token; the token itself never appears in output. A sync sends no further request after the refusal; items it created before are already recorded in the sync state, so the next sync does not create them again |
| `CONNECTOR_REQUEST_FAILED` | `connector` | 1 | external | yes | A request failed: `details.status` (null when the service was unreachable or timed out), `method` and `url`; `details.reason: "stale-revision"` marks a revision guard, `"relations-changed"` an update that was applied but whose link changes could not be confirmed. Throttled requests (429, 503) were already retried |
