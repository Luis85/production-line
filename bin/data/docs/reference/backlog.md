# Backlog

[Documentation](../index.md) · Reference

`backlog` manages a product backlog that the Obsidian [Product Backlog view](https://github.com/Luis85/backlog-view) (backlog-view) opens unchanged: Epics, Features, PBIs and Tasks in a hierarchy, one global rank, workflow states, iterations, releases and dependencies, all as frontmatter of ordinary Markdown notes. It is contributed by the `backlog` [core plugin](plugins.md#bundled-core-plugins) (`src/plugins/backlog/` in the Forge source), enabled by default. It requires the `bases.query` service of the `bases` core plugin, so disabling `bases` makes `backlog` unavailable: `plugins` lists it as `unavailable` with the reason, and its commands fail with `PLUGIN_UNAVAILABLE`. `backlog sync` uses the optional `connector.hub` service of the `connector` core plugin; while `connector` is disabled or unavailable, `backlog sync` fails with `PLUGIN_SERVICE_MISSING` and every other action keeps working.

Forge conforms to backlog-view 0.10.0 (plugin id `product-backlog-view`) with the global rank and release-join dates of commit `fb813df` on its `main` branch. The [conformance](#conformance) section lists what the fixtures prove and where Forge differs.

```sh
node bin/forge.js backlog init --folder docs/backlog
node bin/forge.js backlog add Epic "Trip planning"
node bin/forge.js backlog add Feature "Route sharing" --parent "Trip planning"
node bin/forge.js backlog move "Route sharing" --first
node bin/forge.js backlog set "Route sharing" --state Active
node bin/forge.js backlog tree
node bin/forge.js backlog check
```

## The base is the configuration

A backlog is one `product-backlog` view of a `.base` file. The base's filters (global and view filters) select the notes; the view's options bind roles to frontmatter keys and declare vocabularies. Forge evaluates the filter with the [Bases engine](bases.md) and reads every option the way backlog-view's `settingsResolve.ts` does:

- Property options hold Bases property ids such as `note.status`; a bare name is a note property. An unbound optional property turns its feature off, and Forge then never writes that key (`BACKLOG_WRITE_REFUSED` with `reason: "unbound-property"`).
- Lists are comma-separated strings, trimmed, empty entries dropped and (for vocabularies) de-duplicated case-insensitively.
- Booleans are YAML booleans; anything else means the default.
- Clearable options (`homeFolder`, `typeFolder.<type>`, `resourceFolder`, `horizonValues`, `riskValues`, `priorityValues`, `tagsProperty`, `releaseDateProperty`, `releaseFolder`) mean the default while absent and "off" while present but empty.

| Option | Default | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `parentProperty`, `orderProperty`, `typeProperty` | `parent`, `order`, `type` | Hierarchy, rank and type |
| `stateProperty`, `stateValues`, `doneValues` | unbound, observed states, `Done, Closed, Completed, Removed` | States and board columns |
| `startedStates`, `startedDateProperty`, `finishedDateProperty` | none | Start and finish stamps |
| `wipLimit.<state>`, `columnPolicy.<state>` | none | Board limits (integers of at least 1, never on done states) and policies |
| `deliverableStateProperty`, `deliverableStateValues`, `deliverableDoneValues`, and the `test…` equivalents | the requirements workflow | Own workflows of Deliverables and test-ladder items |
| `startProperty`, `targetProperty`, `horizonProperty`, `horizonValues` | unbound, `Now, Next, Later` | Planned dates and the roadmap horizon |
| `riskProperty`, `riskValues`, `priorityProperty`, `priorityValues` | unbound, `1 - High, 2 - Normal, 3 - Low`, `1 - Must, 2 - Should, 3 - Could, 4 - Won't` | Labels; a value matching a declared one is written in its declared spelling |
| `assigneeProperty` | unbound | One link to a `type: Resource` note |
| `dependsOnProperty` | unbound | Prerequisite link lists |
| `iterationProperty`, `iterationGoalProperty`, `iterationLengthDays` | unbound, unbound, 14 | Iterations |
| `releaseProperty`, `releaseDateProperty` | unbound, `target-date` | Release membership and a release's target date |
| `homeFolder`, `typeFolder.<type>`, `resourceFolder` | `docs`, `<home>/<subfolder>`, `<home>/resources` | Where new notes go |
| `hierarchyOnly`, `showOutsideParents`, `inferFolderHierarchy` | `true`, `true`, `false` | Pruning, context ancestors and folder mode |

Releases are managed by the base's first `product-release` view, with its own options: `membershipProperty`, `versionProperty`, `targetDateProperty`, `releaseStatusProperty`, `releasedDateProperty`, `descriptionProperty`, `estimateProperty`, `capacityProperty`, `dependsOnProperty`, `riskProperty`, `criticalRiskValues`, `addressedRiskValues`, `releasedStatusValues`, `releasedTransitionValue`, `releaseNotesFolder` and `releaseFolder` (default `docs/releases`). Estimation, My Work and absence views are read as part of the base but not edited.

### Choosing the backlog

Every action except `init` and `sync` opens one backlog: `--base <file.base> [--view <name>]`; otherwise `plugins.settings.backlog.base` and `.view` in `bin/config.json`; otherwise the only `product-backlog` view among the scope's `.base` files, preferring views that are not [bound to a connection](#bound-views-define-the-sync-set). No view fails with `BACKLOG_NOT_FOUND`; several fail with `BACKLOG_AMBIGUOUS` and `details.candidates` (`{base, view}` pairs).

```json
{ "plugins": { "settings": { "backlog": { "base": "docs/Product Backlog.base", "view": "Backlog" } } } }
```

## The model

- **Results and context rows.** The view's results are the items, in Bases result order. With `showOutsideParents`, ancestors the filter leaves out are loaded as read-only context rows (`context: true`): they place results in the tree but are never written or counted.
- **Hierarchy.** A note's parent is the first frontmatter link of the parent key (a list uses its first entry); a bare name or `[[Note#Heading|Alias]]` resolves like Obsidian's `getFirstLinkpathDest`: a name several notes share opens the closest one (see [Bases file context](bases.md#file-context)). An unresolved parent makes the note an orphan root (`orphan: true`). A parent loop is cut at the note that closes it (`backlog check` reports `parent-cycle`). In folder mode, a note without a parent value hangs under the nearest folder note (`a/b/b.md`); `parent: ""` is an explicit root. With `hierarchyOnly`, a root subtree with no parent links, folder parents or known types is pruned (`ignored`).
- **Types.** Matched case-insensitively and written canonically. The ladder is Epic → Feature → PBI → Task, the test ladder Test suite → Test case → Task; a child takes the rung below its parent and the deepest rung is clamped. Issue, Bug, Idea, Deliverable and Improvement rank with PBI. Milestone, Iteration and Release are markers. Untyped notes take the implied rung (`impliedType: true`); unknown types are kept. `Resource` and `Absence` notes are never items.
- **Ranks.** `order` is one global rank across everything the base returns. Items sort by rank, ties by result order, unranked last; siblings use the same order. `rank` in the output is the 1-based global position.
- **States.** `done` matches the done values case-insensitively. Deliverables and test-ladder items use their own workflow keys and values, falling back to the requirements workflow.
- **Dependencies.** Entries of the dependsOn list that are unresolved, self-referencing or on a loop (Tarjan's strongly connected components) are broken (`brokenDependencies` with `reason` `unresolved` or `cycle`) but stay on disk. Markers and context rows declare none.
- **Releases.** An item belongs to a release when its membership key holds exactly one link to a `type: Release` note of the release view. A missing key or an empty list names none; `''` (such as `release: ""`), a list of two or more, a non-string, a non-Release target, a marker or a test-ladder item is an unresolved membership.

## Commands

All actions take `--base`, `--view` and `--today YYYY-MM-DD` (the date used for stamps and defaults; default: today in local time). Items are named by vault path (with or without `.md`), link text, title (case-insensitive) or `pbl-id` (`#12`); a title shared by several items fails with `BACKLOG_AMBIGUOUS`.

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `init [--folder docs]` | Writes the plugin's "Create backlog" scaffold to `<folder>/Product Backlog.base` (then ` 1`, ` 2`… when taken): `file.inFolder("<folder>")`, Markdown only, one `product-backlog` view named Backlog with `homeFolder`. Returns `{path, folder, view, changes}` |
| `list [--context]` | `{base, view, total, items, ignored}`: items by global rank; `--context` adds context rows |
| `tree` | `{base, view, roots, ignored}`: the hierarchy in sibling rank order, each node with `items` |
| `board` | `{base, view, stateProperty, columns}`: the no-state column first, then `stateValues` (or observed states plus a done value), then observed states outside the workflow (`outsideWorkflow`). Each column has `state`, `done`, `limit`, `over` (items above the WIP limit), `policy`, `count` and `cards`. Deliverables are not on this board |
| `show <item>` | `{item, ancestors, childItems, dependents}` |
| `add <type> <title> [--parent] [--folder] [--state] [--iteration] [--release] [--assignee] [--tags a,b]` | A new note exactly as `createBacklogItem` writes it (see [new notes](#new-notes)); `item` names its `path`, `id` and `order` |
| `move <item> [--parent <item> or --top] [--before <item>, --after <item>, --first or --last]` | Reparents and/or reorders; writes only the note's parent and order. See [ranks](#ranks) |
| `ranks seed` / `ranks respace` | Renumbers every result 1000, 2000… in tree preorder (`seed`) or current rank order (`respace`), around the ranks of context rows, which stay fixed |
| `set <item> [--state] [--horizon] [--priority] [--risk] [--start] [--due] [--assignee] [--type]` | One write with the given fields; an empty value (`--horizon ""`) deletes the key. See [state writes](#state-writes) |
| `depend <item> --on <item>` / `undepend <item> --on <item>` | Appends `"[[link]]"` to the dependsOn list, or removes entries naming that note (by resolved path, else raw text); the key is deleted when the list empties |
| `iteration add [--name] [--goal] [--start] [--due] [--length days]` | A new Iteration: `<N> - Iteration[ - <goal>]` with N the highest leading number plus one and the goal cut to 60 characters, starting the day after the latest iteration's target (or today) and `iterationLengthDays` long |
| `iteration assign <item> <iteration>` | Links the iteration and overwrites the item's start and target with the iteration's dates |
| `release add <title> [--release-version] [--target-date] [--status] [--description]` | A Release note as `createRelease` writes it, in the release view's `releaseFolder` |
| `release join <item> <release>` | Links the release (backlog view's `releaseProperty`); fills start (today) and target (the release's `target-date`) only while each is empty and the span stays valid |
| `release list` | The release index of the release view: per release `version`, `target`, `status`, `released`, `members`, `done`, `shipped`, `overdue`, `daysToTarget`, `slip`; plus `unresolved` memberships |
| `release readiness <release>` | Direct members' readiness, writing nothing: `criteria` `estimated`, `blocked` and `risk`, each `satisfied`, `partly`, `not`, `unconfigured` or `empty` with `outstandingPaths`; `estimatedEffort`, `completedEffort`, `unestimated` and the `scope` tree |
| `release notes <release>` | Writes `<releaseNotesFolder>/<release> release notes.md` (see [release notes](#release-notes)); `outcome` is `created`, `updated` or `unchanged` |
| `release mark-released <release>` | Writes `releaseStatusProperty = releasedTransitionValue` and `releasedDateProperty = today` on the release note only; `backlog.released` follows |
| `check` | `{ok, counts, writable, problems}`. See [check](#check) |
| `sync`, `sync status`, `sync resolve <item>` | Two-way sync of bound views with external trackers; see [sync](#sync-with-external-trackers) |

Mutating actions accept `--dry-run` (planned changes with unified diffs, nothing written, no `backlog.*` events) and, where one note is edited, `--if-match <revision>` for that note. Committed writes publish `vault.*` records and these events:

| Event | Payload |
| --- | --- |
| `backlog.item-created` | `{path, title, type, id, parent?, order?}` for `add`, `iteration add` and `release add` |
| `backlog.item-moved` | `{path, parent, order, previousParent, previousOrder}` |
| `backlog.state-changed` | `{path, title, from, to, started?, finished?}`: `from` and `to` are values of the item's own workflow (requirements, deliverable or test); `started` and `finished` belong to the requirements workflow (`finished: null` when leaving done) |
| `backlog.released` | `{path, name, status, released}` |
| `backlog.synced` | `{base, view, connection, created, updated, pulled, conflicts, left, failed}` once per synced view |

## Sync with external trackers

`backlog sync` keeps backlog notes and the work items of an external tracker in sync in both directions, with explicit conflicts. Connectors are plugin services: the `connector` core plugin holds the [connection profiles](connectors.md#connection-profiles) and `connector-azure-devops` talks to [Azure DevOps Boards](connector-azure-devops.md). The sync engine itself lives in this plugin and knows no platform. A [how-to guide](../how-to/sync-backlog-with-azure-devops.md) walks through a first sync.

### Bound views define the sync set

A `product-backlog` view with the view option `connection: <id>` is bound to that connection. Its query (global and view filters) selects the notes held in sync; its options bind the properties as for every other action. One base can hold several bound views, each with its own filter and connection, so different item sets of one repository sync to different organizations or projects. backlog-view ignores the extra option.

```yaml
views:
  - type: product-backlog
    name: Planning
    filters:
      and:
        - file.inFolder("backlog/requirements")
    stateProperty: note.status
    priorityProperty: note.priority
    connection: contoso
```

When an action other than `sync` chooses its backlog by discovery, unbound views are preferred; with only bound views, pass `--base`/`--view` or set `plugins.settings.backlog`.

### Actions

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `sync [--base … [--view …]] [--direction push\|pull\|both]` | Syncs every bound view (or the named ones), default `both`. `--dry-run` reads the remote, writes nowhere and returns the planned remote operations and vault diffs |
| `sync status [--base … --view …]` | Reads both sides and reports pending pushes, pulls and conflicts; writes nothing |
| `sync resolve <item> --take local\|remote [--field title,state]` | Settles the note's conflicting fields (all, or the named ones) in favour of one side; its other pending changes wait for the next sync. A named field that is not in conflict, or a note without conflicts, is `INVALID_ARGUMENT`; a note in several bound views needs `--base`/`--view` |

The result is `{dryRun, mode, direction, counts, views, left, changes}`. Each view reports `{base, view, connection, platform, created, updated, pulled, conflicts, resolved, unchanged, skipped, failed, changes}`:

- `created`, `updated` and `pulled` list `{path, remoteId, url, fields}` (`remoteId` and `url` are null for creates a dry run only plans; a pulled title adds `renamedTo`).
- `conflicts` lists `{path, remoteId, url, fields: [{field, local, remote}]}` with both canonical values.
- `skipped` lists `{path, code, reason, field?}`: a note or one of its fields the sync left alone. The codes are below.
- `failed` lists `{path, remoteId, code, message}` for remote writes that failed; `SYNC_CONFLICT` marks a remote item that changed during the sync, or whose links changed on the other end while an update changed them (the connector's `relations-changed`): the update may then have removed another link than planned, so the note's `parent` and `dependencies` lose their base and the next sync reports them as conflicts wherever the two sides differ, never pulling the remote links over the note. A refused token aborts the whole sync with `CONNECTOR_AUTH_FAILED`, after recording every item created before it.
- `changes` lists the vault changes; a note renamed for a pulled title appears as `{path, oldPath, operation: "renamed", revision, bytes}` (with `diff: null` on dry runs) before the link rewrites.

`left` lists, per connection, the state entries whose note no bound view of that connection returns any more (`{connection, path, remoteId, url}`), across all bound views of the scope, so a note held by another view of the same connection is not reported. They are never deleted remotely.

| Skip `code` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `unmapped-type` | The note's type has no remote type mapping |
| `foreign-link` | The link property names an item of another connection |
| `duplicate-link` | Another note already syncs the linked item (a copied note), or, without a state entry, several notes link it; remove or change the link in the copy |
| `remote-missing` | The linked remote item no longer exists or is not readable |
| `not-created` | A pull-only run does not create new notes remotely |
| `unexpressible` | The note's value cannot be expressed on this connection (a parent or a dependsOn entry that does not sync here or does not resolve, a priority label without a number, a non-text area), so the remote value is not pulled over it |
| `unreadable-remote` | The remote value cannot be read (a structured value), so the note's value is not pushed over it |
| `remote-format-unknown` | The remote description changed but is not known to be Markdown; it is not pulled (see descriptions below) |
| `unmapped-remote-type` | The remote type has no local type mapping; the note keeps its type |
| `unsynced-parent`, `unsynced-dependency`, `missing-iteration` | A pulled parent, predecessor or iteration has no local counterpart; or a predecessor this run should have created was not, so the links wait for the next sync |
| `title-taken` | A pulled title's file name is taken |
| `server-kept` | The platform stored another value than the one pushed (a rule); the note keeps its value and the next sync pushes it again |
| `server-applied` | On a push-only run, the platform filled a field the note leaves empty (a default or rule); the next two-way sync pulls it |

### Fields and the three-way comparison

| Field | Note side | Remote side (Azure DevOps default) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | The note's file name (basename) | `System.Title` |
| `type` | `typeProperty`, mapped through the connection's types | `System.WorkItemType` |
| `state` | `stateProperty`, mapped through the connection's states | `System.State` |
| `parent` | `parentProperty`, when the parent syncs on the same connection | Parent link (`System.LinkTypes.Hierarchy-Reverse`) |
| `dependencies` | `dependsOnProperty`: the notes the list names, when every entry resolves to a note synced on the same connection; compared as a set of remote ids | Predecessor links (`System.LinkTypes.Dependency-Reverse`); see [dependencies](#dependencies) |
| `iteration` | `iterationProperty`: the Iteration note's name under the connection's `iterationRoot` | `System.IterationPath` |
| `area` | The connection's `areaProperty` (default `area`), a full area path; a note without it is in the connection's default area | `System.AreaPath` |
| `priority` | `priorityProperty`: the label's leading number (`1 - Must` → 1) | `Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority` |
| `effort` | The connection's `effortProperty` (default `effort`), a number | Story points or effort, by process |
| `tags` | `tagsProperty`, compared case-insensitively | `System.Tags` |
| `description` | The whole note body after the frontmatter, without `%%comments%%` | `System.Description` |
| `property:<key>` | Extra frontmatter keys from the connection's `mappings.properties` | The mapped remote field |

A field syncs only when the connection maps it and the view binds its property; it is then compared in canonical form (sanitized titles, trimmed text, sorted lowercase tags). For every note and connection, the state file `.forge/sync/<connection>.json` in the command scope stores the remote id, URL and revision and, per field, a hash of the value both sides held after the last successful sync. Each sync compares both sides with that base:

- changed only in the note: pushed with a revision-guarded update;
- changed only remotely: pulled through the backlog's write rules (state stamps, `mayHoldField`, Obsidian's YAML style; a new title renames the note and rewrites links to it, and a note re-parented to a renamed note in the same run links its new name);
- changed on both sides to different values: a conflict, reported (`connector.conflict`) and left untouched on both sides until `sync resolve`; to the same value: converged;
- no base (a fresh clone without the state file, a deleted state file, a link property added by hand): every differing field is a conflict, so a relink never overwrites either side;
- a side that cannot express or read the field (see `unexpressible` and `unreadable-remote`): never overwritten, and never cleared with an empty value; the field is skipped.

While the remote revision equals the stored one, the remote side counts as unchanged, except for `parent` and `dependencies`: a link added or removed on the item at the other end changes this item's links without a new revision, so they are always compared. The stored revision advances only once every remote change has landed. New notes (no state, no link property) are created remotely in tree order, parents before children. The base of a pushed or created field is the value the platform returned, not the value sent: a field the note leaves empty that the platform filled (a default state or priority, a rule) is pulled into the note in the same run, and a value the platform stored differently is reported as `server-kept`. After a create or relink, the note's link property (default `azure-devops`, set per connection with `linkProperty`) holds the remote URL, which Obsidian opens as a link; backlog-view keeps the unknown key. A note renamed through Forge (`move`, `rename`, `app.fileManager`) keeps its state, because the plugin follows `vault.rename`; a note renamed elsewhere is relinked by its link property on the next sync. A copied note with the same link property never takes over its original's item (`duplicate-link`). Remote items without a note are not imported: the sync set is defined by the view (see the [connector's limitations](connector-azure-devops.md#limitations) for why an import does not fit yet).

### Dependencies

With `dependsOnProperty` bound, a note's dependsOn list syncs with its remote item's predecessors. Both sides compare as the sorted set of remote ids, so order and duplicates in the list do not count. A list syncs only when every entry resolves to a note synced on the same connection; otherwise the field is `unexpressible` and the remote value is never pulled over it. Remote writes run in two phases per view: first creates and field updates (parents before children), then links, once every note created in the run has its remote id, so a note may depend on a note the same run creates, in any order. A created note's parent and links are recorded as the create stored them (none), so when a predecessor or parent could not be created, or the link update failed, the next sync pushes them; a conflict names a note still to be created by its path. A link update sets the item's predecessors to exactly the list, adding and removing links. A pulled change rewrites the list in backlog-view's form: entries that still name a predecessor keep their text and order, a new predecessor is appended as `"[[link]]"` (the shortest link text, as `backlog depend` writes it), and an emptied list deletes the key; a remote predecessor without a synced note is skipped (`unsynced-dependency`). A list changed differently on both sides is a conflict that `sync resolve --field dependencies` settles. Linking two items also changes the other item's links; when that moves the other item's revision before its own update in the same run, the update is repeated once at the fresh revision, as long as none of its synced values changed.

**Descriptions.** The note body is pushed as it is, including embeds, wikilinks (Azure DevOps shows them as plain text) and Markdown it cannot render, but without Obsidian `%%comments%%`, which stay private. The state keeps two bases for the description: the note body, and the remote text exactly as read (Markdown or HTML), so a change is detected on each side by itself. A note change pushes while the remote text is still the one last synced. A remote change is pulled only when the platform declares the text as Markdown; otherwise it is skipped (`remote-format-unknown`) and becomes a conflict once the note changes too. `sync resolve --field description` settles either case: `--take local` pushes the note body, `--take remote` writes the remote text into the body as it is. A pulled description keeps the note's `%%comments%%`, appended after it.

Remote writes are planned before anything is written. A live sync holds the lock file `.forge/sync/<connection>.lock` at the workspace root for every connection it syncs, from start to end, so a second sync of the same connection fails with `WORKSPACE_BUSY` instead of interleaving, also when one runs in a project scope and the other in the workspace scope (connection profiles are workspace settings and both write to the same remote project). A lock left by a sync whose process no longer runs is removed with a warning, as the [write contract](cli.md#write-contract) describes. SIGINT or SIGTERM stops a live sync at the next safe point (before its next remote write or vault commit) with `SYNC_INTERRUPTED` (exit 130, or 143), after releasing its locks; a second signal terminates at once. Each created item is recorded in the state file right after its create, so a later failure (a refused token, a rejected write, a vault conflict) never loses its id and the next sync does not create it again; a state file another process changed meanwhile is re-read and merged. Committed syncs publish `vault.*` records for note changes, then per view `connector.pushed` per remote write, `connector.pulled` per pulled note, `connector.conflict` per conflicting note and one `backlog.synced` (its `left` counts the connection's notes that left the sync set). Dry runs and `status` publish none of them.

## New notes

A new note is one file holding only frontmatter, `---\n<yaml>---\n`, with keys in backlog-view's order: `pbl-id`, type, parent (`""` for a root in folder mode, otherwise absent), order, goal, iteration, release, then horizon, start and target. Forge appends the optional `--state` (in its [workflow's spelling](#state-writes), with its stamps), `--assignee` and `--tags` after them, in the order a later edit would add them. `--tags` is read like a frontmatter tags string, split on commas and whitespace with a leading `#` optional, and each tag is normalized as the plugin's tag editor writes it: characters Obsidian does not allow are trimmed at the edges and become `-` inside (`needs-review!` gives `needs-review`, `a!b` gives `a-b`), tags without a non-digit character such as `2026` are dropped, and duplicates are removed case-insensitively.

- **Name.** The title passes `sanitizeTitle`: `\ / : * ? " < > | # ^ [ ]` become `-`, whitespace collapses, leading `-`, space and `.` and trailing `-` and space are trimmed, and an empty result is `Untitled`. A taken name gets ` 1`, ` 2`… (compared case-insensitively). The basename is the title; no title property is written.
- **Folder.** In folder mode, beside the parent; otherwise `typeFolder.<type>`, else `homeFolder`, else the folder most results live in. `--folder` overrides.
- **Id.** `pbl-id` is the highest numeric `pbl-id` in the scope plus one.
- **Rank.** The end of the new sibling group under the global rank.
- **Links.** `"[[<fileToLinktext>]]"`: the basename when it resolves uniquely, otherwise the path without `.md`.
- **YAML.** Obsidian's `stringifyYaml` style: block mappings and lists, plain scalars where YAML allows, double quotes otherwise (`"[[Note]]"`, `""`, `"12"`).

Releases get `pbl-id`, type and the stated version, target date, status and description, and never an order or planning link. Iterations get the goal and their start and target.

## Ranks

`move` places the note between the neighbours its position implies in the global rank: the midpoint rounded to 6 decimals, or `floor(neighbour) ± 1000` at an edge, 1000 in an empty backlog. On a global tie it falls back to sibling-scoped arithmetic when that rank is free. Otherwise it refuses with `BACKLOG_NO_GAP` and `details.reason`: `tied`, `gapSpent`, `unranked` (a neighbour has no rank). Run `ranks respace` (or `ranks seed`) and move again. A move that keeps the parent and lands the note where it already is among its siblings (such as `--last` on the last sibling) writes nothing: `changes` is empty and no event follows, unless it clears a parent link that resolves to nothing. A move under the note itself or a descendant is refused (`parent-cycle`), and so is a move between the plan and the test catalog (`projection`). Ranks need not be unique; `check` reports ties.

## State writes

A state write uses the item's own workflow: Deliverables use the deliverable workflow, test-ladder items the test workflow, everything else the requirements workflow. A typed state that matches one of the workflow's declared values (its state values and done values) case-insensitively is written in the declared spelling (`--state "in progress"` writes `In Progress`), as a board column writes it; other values are written as typed. `--horizon`, `--priority` and `--risk` match `horizonValues`, `priorityValues` and `riskValues` the same way. Setting the state the item already holds, in any case, writes nothing. In the requirements workflow, `startedDateProperty` is stamped with `--today` when the state actually changes into a `startedStates` value and the key is empty; `finishedDateProperty` is stamped when crossing into a done value and deleted when crossing out; done to done writes nothing. Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`; an existing time suffix on a planned date is kept, and an equal date is left alone.

## Refusals and the write gate

Every write first re-reads the note and refuses the whole batch, writing nothing, with `BACKLOG_WRITE_REFUSED` and `details.reason`:

| Reason | When |
| --- | --- |
| `outside-filter` | The note is a context row or not in the backlog |
| `resource` | The note is a `type: Resource` note |
| `field-not-held` | The type may not hold the field: a release link on markers and test-ladder items; horizon, dates, iteration or goal on a Release; a start on a Milestone (or an Iteration without bars, through `set`) |
| `not-a-release`, `not-a-resource`, `not-an-iteration` | A release, assignee or iteration link to a note of another type |
| `reversed-span` | The start would fall after the target |
| `parent-cycle`, `projection` | See [ranks](#ranks) |
| `marker`, `dependency-cycle` | A marker as a dependent or parent of a new item; a dependency that closes a loop |
| `reserved-type`, `use-release-add` | `Resource`/`Absence` items; Releases through `add` |
| `unbound-property` | The feature's property is not bound in the view |
| `already-released`, `unreadable` | `mark-released` on a released release or an unreadable status or date |
| `foreign-release-notes` | The release notes file was not generated from this base, view and release |

While two roles share one key (the three workflow-state roles may share), every write fails with `BACKLOG_CONFIG_PROBLEM` and `details.problems`. Unknown keys and every untouched frontmatter entry keep their bytes, including comments and folding; changed entries are rewritten in Obsidian's style, so a `""` stub becomes `priority: P1`.

## Release notes

The file starts with the marker `<!-- Generated by the Product Backlog view from "<source>". Rewritten in full whenever it is regenerated. -->`, where the source is `<base path> › <release view name> › <release path>` with `%` and `›` escaped in each part and then `%`, `<`, `>`, CR, LF and `-` before `-` percent-encoded. Then `# <release>`, two fixed sentences, `## <Type>` groups in vocabulary order with `- <title>` bullets in scope-tree order, and `## Other` for unknown types; an empty release says "This release contained nothing.". The content is undated and deterministic. An existing file is replaced only when its marker names the same source; otherwise the action is refused. Notes require `releaseNotesFolder` and `membershipProperty`.

## Check

`check` reads the backlog and reports `problems`, each `{code, severity, message, path?, key?, value?, paths?}`. `ok` is false when any is an error.

| Code | Severity | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config`, `release-config` | error | Roles sharing a key; release properties sharing a key, released date = target date, a transition value that is not a released value, a membership key colliding with another role |
| `parent-cycle`, `unresolved-parent` | error | A cut parent loop; a parent that does not resolve to a loaded note |
| `dependency-cycle`, `unresolved-dependency` | error | Broken dependsOn entries |
| `broken-iteration` | error | An iteration link to a missing or non-Iteration note |
| `unresolved-membership` | error | A release membership that does not resolve to exactly one Release |
| `field-not-held` | error | A field the type may not hold |
| `broken-assignee` | warning | An assignee that is not a Resource note |
| `unreadable-date`, `unreadable-horizon`, `reversed-span` | warning | Values the plugin shelves |
| `rank-tie`, `unranked` | warning | Results sharing a rank; results other than releases without one (releases are created unranked) |
| `unparseable-note`, `ambiguous-link` | warning | The Bases index [warnings](bases.md#compatibility-and-errors) about results and context rows: a note read without properties because it cannot be parsed, and a link (`value`) several notes match that resolves to the closest |

One unparseable note or ambiguous link never fails a backlog command, wherever it is in the scope.

## Conformance

Fixtures copied from backlog-view `fb813df` (its `docs/Product Backlog.base` and plugin-written notes) live in `tests/backlog/fixtures`, with expected outputs derived from the plugin's code:

| Behaviour | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Settings resolution of the plugin's own base, defaults, clearable options, lists, limits, colours, release settings and configuration problems | `tests/backlog/settings.unit.test.ts` |
| Reading plugin-written notes: hierarchy, orphans, global rank with result-order ties, types and ladders, states, board columns, releases and readiness | `tests/backlog/conformance.integration.test.ts`, `model.unit.test.ts`, `releases.unit.test.ts` |
| Round trip: a write to any fixture note changes only the written line | `conformance.integration.test.ts` |
| Created notes, a release and the base scaffold byte-equal to `createBacklogItem`, `createRelease` and "Create backlog" | `fixtures/expected/*`, `notes.unit.test.ts` |
| Rank arithmetic, seed and respace | `ranks.unit.test.ts`, `commands.integration.test.ts` |
| Stamps, refusals, fill-only release dates, dependsOn lists, time suffixes | `writes.unit.test.ts` |
| Release notes text and marker | `releases.unit.test.ts`, `fixtures/expected/Eratic Skunk release notes.md` |
| The complete CLI workflow | `tests/backlog/cli.e2e.test.ts` |

Known differences and open questions:

- Obsidian rewrites the whole frontmatter on every `processFrontMatter`; Forge rewrites only changed entries. Both read the same. YAML style is taken from plugin-written notes; the plugin's tests do not pin Obsidian's exact `stringifyYaml` output, such as where it folds long strings.
- Links in notes resolve like Obsidian: a name several notes share opens the closest one, and a note whose frontmatter cannot be parsed is read without properties; `check` reports both as warnings. Item names given on the command line (`--parent`, `--on`, `--assignee`) must stay unambiguous.
- A bare property name in a view option is read as a note property; Obsidian's `getAsPropertyId` for such hand-edited values is unverified.
- Generated release notes use the plugin's English sentences; the plugin writes its own catalog's text.
- Batches are transactional in Forge, where the plugin applies writes one note at a time and stops at the first refusal.
- Absences, My Work and estimation are read only; renames rely on the kernel `move`, which rewrites frontmatter links.
