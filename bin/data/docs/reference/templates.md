# Markdown templates

[Documentation](../index.md) · Reference

Templates are Markdown files with optional YAML frontmatter in the workspace's shared `bin/templates` directory. The bundled `templates` [core plugin](plugins.md#bundled-core-plugins) delivers the `templates` command, `make document` and the planning workflow pack; `setup` installs its starter templates. With `{"plugins": {"disabled": ["templates"]}}` the command and generator are gone and `setup` skips `bin/templates` with a warning. They produce ordinary Obsidian-compatible `.md` files without requiring Obsidian. Inspect the configuration and available inputs before generating:

```sh
node bin/forge.js config --json
node bin/forge.js templates list --json
node bin/forge.js templates inspect feature.md --json
node bin/forge.js make document 'Feature proposal' --template feature.md --values '{"owner":"Engineering"}' --dry-run
node bin/forge.js make document 'Feature proposal' --template feature.md --values '{"owner":"Engineering"}'
```

`templates inspect` and `make document` both require a `.md` template (case insensitive); other extensions fail with `INVALID_TEMPLATE` before parsing. `--template` is relative to workspace `bin/templates`; output defaults to `notes` inside the active project, or workspace when none is selected. `--out` overrides that output directory within the same scope. The title becomes the output filename, so path separators and unsafe names are rejected. New documents never overwrite existing files. Dry-run validates the rendered document and returns the complete text plus planned revision without writing or emitting `vault.*` events.

Use `--values-from inputs/feature.json` instead of `--values` for large or shell-sensitive JSON input; the input path is relative to the active project, or workspace when none is selected. The two options are mutually exclusive. `--date <ISO timestamp>` supplies a reproducible clock for date/time substitutions. `plugins.settings.templates.dateFormat` and `timeFormat` in `bin/config.json` set the default date and time formats (`YYYY-MM-DD` and `HH:mm`); an invalid section makes the `templates` plugin unavailable with a warning.

## Syntax and safe frontmatter

For example, save this as `bin/templates/feature.md` in the workspace (including when authoring it in Obsidian):

```md
---
title: "{{title}}"
created: {{date}}
owner: "{{owner}}"
status: draft
---
# {{title}}

Owner: {{owner}}
Created {{date:dddd, MMMM Do YYYY}} at {{time:HH:mm:ss}} UTC.

- [ ] Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Domain invariants
- [ ] Tests and documentation
```

`{{title}}`, `{{date}}` and `{{time}}` are reserved built-ins. Other names come from a JSON object passed through `--values` or `--values-from`; reserved names cannot be overridden. Inspection returns unique sorted variable expressions, required user-supplied variables in `requiredVariables`, and built-in variables separately in `builtins`. Missing values fail with `UNKNOWN_TEMPLATE_VARIABLE`, so inspect first and supply every required value.

Date formatting uses Day.js in UTC. Default formats are `YYYY-MM-DD` and `HH:mm`; expressions such as `{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}` specify their own format. `--date` accepts an ISO date or an ISO instant with an explicit timezone, for example `2026-10-07T14:05:06Z`.

A whole YAML scalar placeholder retains its JSON type whether quoted or unquoted: `tags: {{tags}}` with `{"tags":["engineering","review"]}` creates a YAML sequence. YAML AST serialization prevents user values from injecting new properties. A placeholder inside a larger string or Markdown body produces text; arrays and objects use compact JSON. Template body content stays intact except for substitutions. Placeholders are not allowed in YAML keys, comments, tags or anchor names.

Values are substituted once; replacement values containing `{{...}}` are not evaluated again. Templates do not execute JavaScript, arbitrary code expressions, or Obsidian Templater scripts. Review generated content and apply your project's checks after generation.

## Workflow template pack

`setup` installs missing editable templates under workspace `bin/templates/workflow`. In an existing workspace, `templates install workflow` (or `templates install`) installs the same pack. Existing template files are preserved and reported as skipped; installation supports `--dry-run` and uses workspace write orchestration. Repository authors maintain the bundled originals in `docs/templates/workflow`; `docs/templates/projects` holds generated-project code/assets. Those authored assets are packaged under `bin/data/docs/templates`, while commands continue to use the editable workspace `bin/templates` directory.

| Template | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `workflow/prd.md` | Problem, audience, outcomes, scope and acceptance requirements |
| `workflow/use-case.md` | Actor, trigger, preconditions, success flow and alternatives |
| `workflow/build-spec.md` | Implementation boundaries, interfaces and technical decisions |
| `workflow/design.md` | Structure, states and design decisions |
| `workflow/implementation-plan.md` | Traceable implementation steps and dependencies |
| `workflow/test-plan.md` | Requirement-linked cases and verification evidence |
| `workflow/release-plan.md` | Readiness, rollout, operation and rollback evidence |

Every template requires `owner`; `title` and `date` are built-ins supplied by the command and optional `--date`. The generated frontmatter contains `schemaVersion: 1`, `type`, `title`, `owner`, `status: draft` and `created`. The status is fixed: every document starts as `draft`, and the opening line of the body repeats it ("Status: draft"). Templates have no default values, so the status is not an input; when a document moves on, update the `status` property and that line together, for example with `properties --set` and `edit --find "Status: draft" --replace "Status: approved"`, or edit the installed templates in `bin/templates/workflow`. The content is a starter structure, not a claim that discovery, tests or release checks have happened. Preserve explicit unknowns until evidence resolves them. See [use workflow templates](../how-to/use-workflow-templates.md) and the [worked tutorial](../tutorials/idea-to-production.md).
