# UI component definition and target reference

[Documentation](../index.md) · Reference

Markdown files describe a framework-neutral component tree; YAML frontmatter is the strict schema and the body is documentation. The bundled `ui` core plugin provides the `components` command and the `make ui` and `make stories` generators; its settings live in `plugins.settings.ui` (`framework`, `components`, `componentImports`, `componentExports`, `output`, `stories` and the interaction folders), and `{"plugins": {"disabled": ["ui"]}}` removes it, together with `interactions`. For a worked example, follow [your first UI](../tutorials/first-ui.md). For path configuration, transfer and guarded regeneration, use [manage components](../how-to/manage-components.md).

## Definition contract

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schemaVersion` | Required literal `1` |
| `id` | Required unique lowercase kebab-case ID used for references and output filenames |
| `name` | Optional generated component/export name; PascalCase letters/digits starting with an uppercase letter |
| `props` | Optional map of prop declarations with `type: string`, `number` or `boolean`, plus optional `default`, `required`, `description` |
| `state` | Optional component-local scalar declarations with required typed defaults; see [interactions](interactions.md) |
| `root` | One element, component reference or child slot |
| `storybook` | Optional metadata and native extension path |
| Markdown body | Documentation text, also used as Storybook's component description |

An element has `tag` and optional `attrs`, `text`, `children`, and `interactions` (a list of shared interaction IDs). A reference has `component` and optional `props`, `children`. A slot is exactly `{slot: children}` and may occur at most once per definition, including inside reference children; this preserves child identity across all targets. Attributes and prop values are scalar values; bindings use `{{propName}}` or `{{state.name}}` and may appear in text, attributes and reference props. A whole binding retains its scalar type, while surrounding text produces a string. Required reference props without defaults must be supplied. Unknown props, type mismatches, missing references, duplicate IDs, repeated child slots, malformed bindings and cyclic references fail validation.

Frontmatter is a strict schema: unrelated keys are rejected. Use normal HTML attribute names, such as `class`, `for`, `aria-label` and `data-state`; renderers translate supported framework differences. Portable names start with a letter and contain letters, digits, underscores or hyphens. Namespaced attributes containing colons or dots and `v-*` directives are excluded; implement framework-specific directives in native project code. This version also rejects `svg` and `math` namespace roots. Use image assets or native framework code for SVG/MathML until the declarative tree supports namespaces. Props use safe JavaScript identifiers; `children` is reserved for projection. Inline event-handler attributes and executable template expressions are not part of the declarative contract. Text is escaped or rendered through text nodes rather than interpreted as markup. Use [declarative interactions](interactions.md) for generated event handlers and local state updates. Application-specific side effects remain in consuming framework code.

## Target artifacts and dependencies

| `--framework` | Generated artifacts per component | Consuming environment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `html` | `.html` fragment, `.js` DOM factory and `.d.ts` types | Initial HTML snapshot or executable browser ES modules; no UI runtime dependency |
| `htmx` | `.html` fragment, `.js` DOM factory and `.d.ts` types | Browser plus HTMX when using `hx-*` attributes |
| `vanilla` | `.html` fragment, `.js` DOM factory and `.d.ts` types | Browser ES modules; caller mounts DOM with generated declarative handlers |
| `react` | `.tsx` component with typed props | React, React types and TypeScript tooling |
| `vue` | `.vue` single-file component | Vue 3 with TypeScript/SFC tooling |
| `svelte` | `.svelte` component | Svelte with TypeScript support and legacy component/slot syntax support |
| `angular` | `.ts` standalone component | Angular with standalone components, required inputs and TypeScript/decorator tooling |

HTML fragments use defaults at generation time; their JS factories accept runtime props and child DOM nodes. Companion declaration files let TypeScript consumers typecheck those factories without enabling unchecked JavaScript imports. For example, after generating the sample dashboard as `html` into its default folder `ui/html/components`, mount it from a browser module:

```js
import createDashboard from './ui/html/components/dashboard.js';
document.querySelector('#app').append(createDashboard({ title: 'Workspace', count: 5 }));
```

The JS factories are typed through JSDoc that matches their declaration files, and no target emits an unused helper, an unused parameter (one the component does not read is named with a leading `_`) or a literal object spread. Generated output therefore passes a generated project's `lint` and `typecheck` (strict TypeScript with `checkJs`) also when you place it in the project's source with `--out`, for example `src/presentation/ui/<target>`. The project's `analyze` gate additionally requires the output to be imported from an entry point (otherwise its files are reported as unused), the framework packages that React, Vue, Svelte and Angular output imports to be listed as dependencies, and the folder to belong to a boundary zone (as `src/presentation/` does, unlike `src/ui/`). The default `ui/<target>` folders are outside these gates.

Serve modules through your application's HTTP server. HTMX attributes are preserved, but the CLI does not install HTMX or define server endpoints. Dynamic nodes may require the consuming application's normal HTMX initialization. Generated output includes declared component-local state and interactions, but does not include an application router, global state manager, stylesheet, design system, API implementation or framework build configuration.


Story metadata and native extension hooks are documented in the [Storybook reference](storybook.md). The [determinism explanation](../explanation/deterministic-ui.md) describes the generation boundary.
