# Interaction definitions and generated behavior

[Documentation](../index.md) · Reference

Interactions are reusable Markdown files with strict YAML frontmatter. The
`interactions` command belongs to the bundled `ui` core plugin, because the UI
renderers emit the handlers. Components attach their IDs to elements; UI generation resolves those references and emits
executable handlers for HTML, HTMX, vanilla JavaScript, React, Vue, Svelte and
Angular. Follow [the interactive-form tutorial](../tutorials/interactive-form.md)
for a complete example, or [manage interactions](../how-to/manage-interactions.md)
for maintenance commands.

## Definition schema

```markdown
---
schemaVersion: 1
id: toggle-expanded
event: click
actions:
  - type: toggle-state
    state: expanded
  - type: emit
    event: panel:changed
    detail:
      expanded: "{{state.expanded}}"
---
Toggle the owning component's expanded state, then notify the application.
```

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `schemaVersion` | Required literal `1` |
| `id` | Required unique lowercase kebab-case interaction ID |
| `event` | `click`, `dblclick`, `input`, `change`, `submit`, `keydown`, `keyup`, `focus`, or `blur` |
| `keys` | Optional keyboard-key filter for `keydown`/`keyup`; names match `KeyboardEvent.key`, for example `[Enter, Escape]` |
| `preventDefault` | Optional boolean; cancel the event's default browser behavior when the handler matches |
| `stopPropagation` | Optional boolean; stop the original event's propagation when the handler matches |
| `actions` | Required nonempty ordered list of declarative actions |
| Markdown body | Human documentation; never executed as code |

Unknown fields and unsupported event/action kinds are rejected. Keyboard filters
apply before the handler's actions and event cancellation. Multiple interactions
attached to an element handle their declared events in definition-list order.

## Actions

| Action | Fields | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `set-state` | `state`, and exactly one of `value` or `fromEvent` | Assign a literal/binding value or a supported event value to component-local state |
| `toggle-state` | `state` | Invert a declared boolean state field |
| `navigate` | `url` | Navigate to a relative destination or an HTTP(S) URL |
| `emit` | `event`, optional scalar-valued `detail` map | Dispatch a bubbling, composed native `CustomEvent` from the attached element |
| `save-form` | `key` | Store named form fields as JSON in browser `localStorage` under the given key |
| `upload-form` | `url` | POST the form's `FormData`, including selected file bytes, to an explicit relative or HTTP(S) URL |
| `download-form` | `filename` | Download named form fields as a JSON file |

`set-state.value` accepts the same scalar values and bindings as component values.
`fromEvent: value` reads a string from an input/select/textarea on `input` or
`change`; it does not convert numbers. `fromEvent: checked` reads a boolean from
an input on those events. Graph validation checks the attached element and the
declared state's type. Numeric state can be assigned a numeric literal or a
compatible whole binding. Use `input` to commit each text edit; `change` commits
only when that browser event occurs. A state-bound control remains governed by
component state during framework rerenders, so an uncommitted DOM draft is not
guaranteed to survive an unrelated update.

Actions run in order. Later actions read state updates made by earlier actions
in the same handler, including values used in emitted `detail`. An emitted event
cannot reuse native trigger names such as `click` or `submit`, preventing direct
self-dispatch recursion. It has no additional envelope: listeners receive the declared object as
`event.detail`. Native custom events provide the same application boundary in
all seven generated targets; they are not framework-specific callback props or
Angular output declarations.

Navigation rejects executable schemes, protocol-relative URLs, credentials and
unsafe URL syntax. Upload destinations follow the same URL restrictions. The
definition does not permit arbitrary JavaScript, dynamic code evaluation, timers
or conditional expressions. General API workflows, authentication, response
processing and application-specific side effects belong in consuming code.

## Reusable form actions

`interactions init` includes `save`, `upload` and `download`. `save` handles
`submit`, prevents native submission and stores data under `forge-form`.
`upload` handles `submit`, prevents native submission and uses `{{uploadUrl}}`;
the attaching component must declare that prop and provide an explicit endpoint.
`download` handles `click`, prevents its default behavior and downloads
`form-data.json`. Edit or copy these definitions to change their key, URL or
filename; action fields support component bindings.

Attach submit interactions to a `form`, and the download interaction to a
button associated with a form. Form actions read the current browser controls
using `FormData`. Fields need a `name`; disabled controls and unchecked
checkboxes are omitted. Repeated names become ordered arrays in JSON; other
values remain strings. A selected file becomes `{name, size, type, lastModified}`
in saved or downloaded JSON. Only upload transmits file contents. Save replaces
the existing value under its key and does not restore controls automatically.
Storage belongs to the consuming site's origin and can be unavailable or full.

Upload uses `POST` and lets the browser set the multipart content type and
boundary. It uses the browser's `same-origin` credentials policy. Relative URLs
resolve against the document URL. The action provides
no custom headers, response parsing, retries or upload progress; server behavior,
authorization, CORS and validation remain application responsibilities. Download
creates an `application/json` Blob and a temporary download link, then releases
its object URL. Browser download settings still apply.

Listen for these bubbling, composed native events on the attached element or
an ancestor. Success events fire after the action completes:

| Event | `event.detail` |
| --- | --- |
| `forge:save` | `{key, data}` |
| `forge:upload` | `{url, status, ok: true}`; `url` is the resolved absolute URL |
| `forge:download` | `{filename, data}` |
| `forge:interaction-error` | `{action, message}`; `action` is `save-form`, `upload-form` or `download-form` |

Form actions check native form validity before their side effect. Invalid forms,
storage/download failures, rejected requests and non-success HTTP responses emit
`forge:interaction-error` and stop that interaction's remaining actions. Handle
the event in the consuming app to show useful feedback. Form actions complete
in order within an interaction; separate user events can
start concurrent requests. A download success means the browser download was
initiated, not that the user retained the file.

## Component state and attachment

Add component-local state with explicit scalar types and defaults:

```yaml
state:
  expanded:
    type: boolean
    default: false
root:
  tag: button
  attrs:
    type: button
    aria-expanded: "{{state.expanded}}"
  text: "Expanded: {{state.expanded}}"
  interactions: [toggle-expanded]
```

State types are `string`, `number` and `boolean`; defaults are required and must
match the type. `{{propName}}` reads a prop; `{{state.name}}` reads state. Whole
bindings preserve scalar types; interpolation produces text. State belongs to
each component instance and is not shared between instances or persisted.

Attach `interactions` to element nodes, not component references or child slots.
Each reference resolves against the selected shared interaction library. The
component must declare the state fields used by the interaction. Validation
rejects missing IDs, unknown state/prop bindings, incompatible assignments and
invalid event-value sources before generating files. References can be reused
by components with compatible state contracts.

## Libraries, paths and generation

| Setting in `plugins.settings.ui` | Default | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `interactions` | `interactions` | Workspace definition library |
| `interactionImports` | `imports/interactions` | Workspace import source |
| `interactionExports` | `exports/interactions` | Workspace export destination |

`interactions list/init/inspect/validate/create/import/export` manage the library;
`--library` overrides its location. `create <id> --event <event>` creates an
editable starter. `import --from` and `export --out` override transfer paths.
Definitions are discovered recursively and IDs must be unique. Transfer source/destination directories must be disjoint: neither may equal or
contain the other. Transfers use the ordinary create-only, dry-run and revision/event write contract.

`components --interactions-library <directory>` selects the interaction library
used for component graph validation. `make ui` and `make stories` accept the
same override. Interaction sources stay workspace-scoped while generated UI,
stories and revision-manifest files follow the selected project/workspace scope.

There is no standalone interaction-code generator: handlers are emitted with
the components that use them. UI `--plan`, `--plan-out`, `--revisions-from`,
`--check`, `--dry-run` and output-path options retain their existing meanings.
Changing an interaction can change generated components; run the same UI drift
check and reviewed regeneration workflow after editing it.

## Runtime boundaries

Framework targets update state through their native component lifecycle. For
HTML, HTMX and vanilla JavaScript, mount the generated ES-module factory to
activate handlers. A standalone `.html` fragment is the initial static snapshot;
opening or inserting it alone does not attach the generated JavaScript behavior.
HTMX server endpoints and HTMX initialization remain application concerns.

Generated state/actions do not supply a complete widget accessibility contract.
Choose semantic elements, label controls, preserve keyboard access, and test
focus and assistive-technology behavior in the consuming application. Native
form constraints guide users; authorization and server validation remain
application responsibilities. Storybook renders the same executable component;
use native story extensions for interaction tests and application-specific mocks.
