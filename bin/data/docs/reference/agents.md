# Agents

[Documentation](../index.md) · Reference

`agents` manages agent definitions written in the [docker-agent](https://github.com/docker/docker-agent) YAML format and generates Claude Code agents from them. The definition files are the source of truth; generated `.claude/agents/<name>.md` files are outputs. The command is contributed by the `agents` [core plugin](plugins.md#bundled-core-plugins) (`src/plugins/agents/` in the Forge source), enabled by default; `plugins.disabled: ["agents"]` removes it. For a walkthrough, see [manage agent definitions](../how-to/manage-agents.md).

```sh
node bin/forge.js agents list
node bin/forge.js agents validate
node bin/forge.js agents create reviewer --file team.yaml --toolset filesystem,shell --if-match <revision>
node bin/forge.js agents create docs --from-template team
node bin/forge.js agents import code-reviewer --from claude --file team.yaml
node bin/forge.js agents generate --target claude --plan
node bin/forge.js agents generate --target claude --check
```

## Definition files

Definitions live directly in the scope's definitions folder, `agents/` by default (`plugins.settings.agents.directory`), as `*.yaml` or `*.yml`; subfolders are not scanned. One file is a team, exactly as in docker-agent: `agents.<name>` entries plus shared `models`, `providers`, `mcps`, `rag`, `toolsets`, `commands`, `skills` and `permissions`. The default agent is `root` when present, otherwise the first agent. Forge stores the files as written: it never reformats them, and `agents create` and `agents import` add an agent by inserting its text after the last agent, so every other line and comment stays byte for byte.

A `<file>` argument is a file name in the definitions folder (`team.yaml`), or, when it contains `/`, a path relative to the scope (`agents/team.yaml`). `agents create` and `agents import` write only `.yaml` or `.yml` files directly in the definitions folder; any other path fails with `INVALID_PATH`. `instruction_file` paths resolve relative to the definition file's folder: they are cleaned lexically (`./prompt.md` → `prompt.md`, `prompts/../x.md` → `x.md`) and must then name a file in that folder or below it, like Go's `filepath.IsLocal` in docker-agent.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plugins.settings.agents.directory` | `agents` | Scope-relative folder of definition files; a trailing slash is dropped, and an absolute or traversing folder makes the plugin unavailable with a warning |
| `plugins.settings.agents.defaultModel` | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5` | Model of `agents create` without `--model`, and of imported agents whose Claude model cannot be mapped |

### Validation

Validation runs in three stages and reports every finding at once:

1. **YAML.** The file must be UTF-8 YAML; YAML 1.1 merge keys (`<<`) and anchors are supported, duplicate keys and aliases that expand to more than 1,000 nodes are errors of that file only (`yaml-syntax`).
2. **Schema.** The document must match docker-agent's `agent-schema.json` (JSON Schema draft-07, configuration version 16, unknown keys rejected everywhere). Forge vendors the schema pinned to docker-agent commit `cd65d7c` and validates with [Ajv](https://ajv.js.org/); `format: uri` values must be absolute URIs (`schema`).
3. **Semantics.** Forge ports docker-agent's load-time checks from `pkg/config` at the same commit:
   - `version` is absent or `"16"` (an unquoted `16` is read as `"16"`, as docker-agent's loader does); any other version is an `unsupported-version` error. Forge never migrates older files; docker-agent itself upgrades them when it loads them. The version comes from the vendored schema's source (`const Version` in docker-agent's `pkg/config/latest/types.go`).
   - `sub_agents`, `handoffs` and `force_handoff` name local agents or external references (OCI references and URLs, optionally `name:ref`), and an external reference's derived name must not clash with a local agent (`unknown-agent-reference`, `external-agent-conflict`).
   - `force_handoff` never targets the agent itself and never forms a cycle (`force-handoff-self`, `force-handoff-cycle`).
   - `instruction` and `instruction_file` are mutually exclusive, instruction files are local to the definition file's folder after lexical cleaning, and they must exist (`instruction-conflict`, `invalid-instruction-file`, `instruction-file-missing`).
   - Models resolve to a `models` key, an inline `provider/model`, `auto`, or a comma-separated alloy list, recursively; routing rules and RAG strategies too (`unknown-model`). `first_available` selectors stand alone and `compaction_threshold` lies in (0, 1] (`invalid-model`).
   - `use_toolsets`, `use_commands`, `use_skills`, MCP `ref`s to `mcps` entries (others must start with `docker:`), RAG `ref`s, budgets and inline fork-skill toolsets resolve (`unknown-toolset`, `unknown-command-group`, `unknown-skill-group`, `unknown-mcp-definition`, `invalid-mcp-definition`, `unknown-rag-definition`, `unknown-budget`).
   - Toolset fields match their type (for example `path` only on `memory` and `tasks`), each type has its required source (`mcp`: exactly one of `command`, `remote.url` or `ref`; `lsp`: `command`; `a2a`, `openapi`, `open_url`: `url`), domain patterns and OAuth settings are valid (`invalid-toolset`). Providers, harness options and inline skills follow docker-agent's rules (`invalid-provider`, `invalid-harness`, `invalid-skills`).

The conformance suite validates every `examples/*.yaml` of the pinned docker-agent commit without errors. Refresh the vendored schema, its license and the conformance fixtures from a docker-agent checkout with `npm run vendor:docker-agent -- <checkout>` in `src/the-forge`; the distribution's `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` names the vendored commit and ships docker-agent's Apache-2.0 license.

### Diagnostics

Every finding is a diagnostic:

```json
{ "severity": "error", "code": "unknown-model", "pointer": "/agents/root/model", "line": 3, "column": 12, "message": "agent 'root' references non-existent model 'nowhere'." }
```

`pointer` is an RFC 6901 JSON pointer into the parsed definition (`~1` escapes `/`); `line` and `column` are 1-based positions of the pointed value in the YAML, or of its nearest existing parent when the value is missing. Generation and import diagnostics add `fidelity` (see [the mapping](#mapping-to-claude-code)) and `path`, the file the pointer refers to. `severity` is `error` (the file is invalid), `warning` (approximated or dropped behavior you should review) or `info` (settings without a Claude equivalent that change nothing you rely on).

## Commands

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `agents [list]` | `{directory, files}`; each file has `path`, `revision`, `valid`, `version` when declared, `default`, `agents` (`name`, `description`, `model`, `subAgents`) and `errors`/`warnings` counts. Never fails on invalid files |
| `agents inspect <file>` | `{path, revision, valid, default, config, diagnostics}` with the parsed document (`config` is `null` when the YAML does not parse) |
| `agents inspect <file>#<agent>` | `{path, revision, agent, default, definition, instruction?, diagnostics}`; `instruction` is the resolved `instruction_file` text. An unknown agent is `AGENT_NOT_FOUND` |
| `agents validate [file]` | `{directory, valid: true, files: [{path, revision, valid, diagnostics}]}` for one or every file. Any error fails with `INVALID_AGENT_DEFINITION` and `details.files[].diagnostics` |
| `agents create <name>` | Adds an agent (or a template's agents) and returns `{path, agent, agents, created, diagnostics, dryRun, changes}`; `agents` lists every added agent |
| `agents import <agent \| path.md> --from claude` | Converts a Claude agent and adds it like `create`; the result adds `from: {target, path, revision}` |
| `agents generate --target claude` | Generates Claude Code files; see [generation](#generation) |

`agents create <name> [--from-template basic|team|mcp] [--file team.yaml] [--model ref] [--description text] [--instruction text] [--toolset types] [--if-match sha256]` writes a valid docker-agent agent: `model` (default `defaultModel`), `description` (default `The <name> agent.`), `instruction` (default the description) and one toolset per `--toolset` type. `--toolset` accepts types without required settings: `filesystem`, `shell`, `fetch`, `think`, `todo`, `tasks`, `memory`, `user_prompt`, `calculator`, `random`, `datetime`, `environment`, `git`, `plan`, `session_context`, `background_jobs`, `background_agents`, `scheduler`, `mcp_catalog` and `file`; add `mcp`, `lsp`, `api` and other toolsets by editing the YAML. Names start with a letter or digit and contain letters, digits, `-` and `_` (`INVALID_NAME`). `--file` defaults to `<name>.yaml`. A new file starts with a header comment and `version: "16"`; adding to an existing file requires its current revision with `--if-match` (`CONFLICT` otherwise, with `details.currentRevision`) and an agent name the file does not define (`AGENT_EXISTS`). The result is validated before it is written: a file that would become invalid is refused with `INVALID_AGENT_DEFINITION`. Dry runs return the write's unified `diff`.

`--from-template` adds a bundled template's agents instead of one agent with `--toolset` (the two cannot be combined). `--model` applies to every agent of the template; `--description` and `--instruction` to the main agent `<name>`.

| Template | Agents |
| --- | --- |
| `basic` | `<name>` with a read-only `filesystem`, `think` and `todo` |
| `team` | `<name>`, a coordinator with `todo` and `sub_agents: [<name>-researcher, <name>-writer]`; `<name>-researcher` with `fetch` and `think`; `<name>-writer` with `filesystem` |
| `mcp` | `<name>` with the DuckDuckGo MCP server through the Docker MCP Gateway (`ref: docker:duckduckgo`) and `think` |

`agents import <agent> --from claude [--file team.yaml] [--if-match sha256]` reads `.claude/agents/<agent>.md` (or a `.md` path), validates it like `claude agents inspect`, and adds the converted agent to `--file` (default `<name>.yaml` with the sanitized agent name). The conversion is approximate; see [importing Claude agents](#importing-claude-agents).

## Generation

`agents generate --target claude [--file team.yaml] [--agent name] [--mcp none|inline|project [--rename-conflicts]] [--hooks] [--settings [--allow-broad-permissions]] [--commands] [--model-style id|alias] [--plan | --plan-out path.json | --check | --revisions-from path.json]` generates from every definition file, or from `--file`; `--agent` generates one agent of them. Any invalid definition stops generation with `INVALID_AGENT_DEFINITION`, as do two agents or command skills whose sanitized names collide (`agent-name-collision`, `command-name-collision`) and broad permission rules without `--allow-broad-permissions` (`broad-permission`). Generation is a pure function of the definitions, their instruction files and the options, so the same input always produces the same bytes.

### Opt-ins for commands and permissions

Generated Claude files are execution- and permission-bearing: MCP servers start processes, hooks run commands and settings rules approve tool calls without asking. Definition files are treated as untrusted input, so Forge writes none of these unless you opt in, and the plan lists each one:

| Option | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--mcp none\|inline\|project` | `none` | `none` writes no MCP server and grants none of their `mcp__…` tools; each skipped server is an `mcp-not-generated` diagnostic (info) with its command or URL. `inline` writes servers into the agent's `mcpServers` frontmatter; `project` merges them into `.mcp.json` and names them in `mcpServers` |
| `--hooks` | off | Writes command hooks into the agent's `hooks` frontmatter; without it each agent's hooks are one `hooks-not-generated` diagnostic (info) listing every skipped event and command |
| `--settings` | off | Merges permission rules and the main agent into `.claude/settings.json`; without it top-level permissions are `permissions-not-generated` (info) |
| `--allow-broad-permissions` | off | With `--settings`, also writes allow rules that approve a whole tool: `Bash`, `Bash(*)`, `Edit`, `Write`, `NotebookEdit`, `WebFetch` without a domain, or every tool of an MCP server (`mcp__<server>`, `mcp__<server>__*`). Without it each such rule is a `broad-permission` error, nothing is written, and generation fails with `INVALID_AGENT_DEFINITION` |
| `--rename-conflicts` | off | With `--mcp project`, gives a generated server whose name `.mcp.json` uses for a server Forge did not write a numbered name (`mcp-server-renamed`) instead of failing with `AGENT_MERGE_CONFLICT` |

Every written stdio MCP server (including the Docker MCP Gateway) and every written hook command is an `executes-command` warning whose message holds the full command line, and every rule written to `.claude/settings.json` is a `grants-permission` warning with the exact rule and list; every rule Forge removes from it is a `revokes-permission` warning. Review them in `--plan` before you write.

| Output | When | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.claude/agents/<name>.md` | Always, per agent | Frontmatter from the mapping, the instruction as the body and `x-forge-source: {path, agent, sourceHash, optionsHash, outputHash}` provenance. Each file passes Forge's Claude agent validation |
| `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | `--commands` | One skill per agent command, with `x-forge-source: {path, agent, command, sourceHash, outputHash}` |
| `.mcp.json` | `--mcp project` and MCP toolsets | The generated servers set under `mcpServers` by name; other servers and keys stay |
| `.claude/settings.json` | `--settings` | Permission rules appended to `permissions.allow`/`ask`/`deny` where missing, rules Forge added earlier that no definition grants any more removed (each a `revokes-permission` warning), and `"agent": "<default agent>"` when one definition file is generated; other settings stay |
| `.claude/forge-generated.json` | When `.mcp.json` or `.claude/settings.json` is written | The manifest of the entries Forge wrote there, with their content: `{description, mcpServers, settings: {agent, permissions: {allow, ask, deny}}}`; each permission list holds only the rules Forge added, as `{rule, origins}` where `origins` lists the definitions that grant the rule: `{file}` for a file's top-level `permissions`, `{file, agent}` for the rules an agent's toolsets derive |

Provenance records what an output was generated from: `path` (the definition file), `agent` (the docker-agent agent name), `sourceHash` (SHA-256 over the definition file's revision and its resolved instruction files), `optionsHash` (agents only: SHA-256 of `--mcp`, `--hooks` and `--model-style`, the options that shape agent files) and `outputHash` (SHA-256 of the file as rendered without its provenance).

Merges into `.mcp.json` and `.claude/settings.json` change only entries Forge owns: an entry the manifest records with exactly its current content. A generated server whose name `.mcp.json` uses for any other server is an `mcp-server-conflict`, and a settings `agent` Forge did not write is a `settings-agent-conflict`; both stop generation with `AGENT_MERGE_CONFLICT`. An entry you edit after Forge wrote it becomes yours. Permission rules are owned the same way: the manifest records each rule Forge appended with its origins, a later `--settings` generation removes a recorded rule that no definition grants any more (dropping a list or the `permissions` object that it leaves empty) and reports each removal as a `revokes-permission` warning in the plan and the result, and a rule that was already in the file when Forge would have added it stays yours and is never removed. A generation re-derives only the origins it covers: all of them without `--file` and `--agent`, the named file's with `--file`, and with `--agent` only that agent's own rules, never its file's top-level `permissions` (which depend on every agent's servers). Every run also covers the origins of definition files that no longer exist in the scope (a definition file outside the definitions directory, such as one generated with `--file shared/guard.yaml`, keeps its rules while it exists; Forge does not follow symlinks, so a file reached only through one counts as gone), so after a rename or a deletion the old file's rules are revoked (with `revokes-permission`) by the next run, and a `--check` with the same options reports the settings file as `changed` until then. A recorded rule loses only covered origins, so a `--file a.yaml` run never removes a rule that `b.yaml` grants. A rule you remove by hand is forgotten; one you add by hand with the same text as a recorded rule cannot be told apart from it. Without `--settings`, a generation leaves the settings file and its recorded rules alone. Merged files keep their indentation (spaces or tabs), line endings, final newline and key order; new keys are appended.

The result is `{target, agents: [{agent, name, path, source}], skills, files: [{path, status}], stale, diagnostics, …}`. Each output's `status` is:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `missing` | The file does not exist yet |
| `unchanged` | The file already has the generated bytes |
| `changed` | The file differs but still matches the `outputHash` its provenance recorded: the definition, an instruction file or the options changed |
| `hand-edited` | The file no longer matches the `outputHash` its provenance recorded, or it has no provenance: someone edited the output or it was written by hand |

`stale` lists `.claude/agents/*.md` and `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` files whose provenance names a generated definition file that no longer produces them, such as a removed agent. Forge never deletes them; remove them with `delete` after review. `--agent` skips the stale scan.

Review and writes follow the shared generation pattern of `make ui`:

- `--plan` writes nothing and adds `{plan: true, matches, revisions, outputs}` with each output's `content` (and `currentContent` when it differs); `--plan-out review.json` also writes the revision manifest.
- Without a review option, generation writes only `missing` outputs (and nothing for `unchanged` ones). Changing an existing file needs its approved revision: run `--plan-out review.json`, review, then `--revisions-from review.json`. Otherwise the write fails with `CONFLICT`, so hand edits are never overwritten silently.
- `--check` writes nothing and succeeds with `{check: true, matches: true}`, or fails with exit 5 and `AGENT_DRIFT`, whose `details` hold `outputs: [{path, status}]` (every output that is not `unchanged`) and `stale`. Pass the same `--mcp`, `--hooks`, `--settings`, `--commands` and `--model-style` options as the generation you check.
- `--dry-run` previews the writes with `preview` contents and publishes `workspace.quick-preview` records.

A committed generation publishes `vault.create`/`vault.modify` for each written file and then `agents.generated` with `{target: "claude", sources, agents, files}` (the written paths); see [events](plugins.md#host-events-and-correlation). `--events all` includes it in the response.

## Mapping to Claude Code

Fidelity **E** is exact; **A** is approximate and emitted with a warning diagnostic; **U** is unsupported, not emitted, and recorded as a diagnostic (a warning when behavior is lost, otherwise info). The codes in the last column appear in `diagnostics`.

| docker-agent | Claude Code artifact | Fidelity | Diagnostic codes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agents.<name>` | `.claude/agents/<name>.md`; the name is lowercased and runs of other characters than `a-z0-9-` become `-` | E | `name-sanitized` (info) when it changes |
| Default agent (`root`, else the first) | Same file; with `--settings` also `"agent": "<name>"` in `.claude/settings.json` | A | `main-agent-approximated` |

| `${env.X}` and other `${…}` templates in prompts and descriptions | Kept literally | A (`env`)/U | `template-literal` |
| `add_date`, `add_environment_info` | Not emitted; Claude Code adds both to its system prompt | A | `prompt-option-approximated` (info) |
| `add_prompt_files`, `add_prompt_files_depth`, `welcome_message` | Not emitted | U | `prompt-option-unsupported` |
| Model `anthropic/<id>`, or a named model whose provider (or custom provider type) is `anthropic` | `model: <id>`; `--model-style alias` emits the family alias `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku` or `fable` | E/A | `model-alias` with aliases |
| `auto`, alloys, `first_available`, other providers, no model | First Anthropic candidate in order, otherwise `model: inherit` | A | `model-approximated` |
| Sampling, endpoint, auth, routing, cost and other settings of the chosen model | Not emitted | U | `model-setting-unsupported` (info) |
| `thinking_budget` of the chosen model | `effort`: levels map by name, `adaptive` → `high`, `adaptive/<level>` → level, token budgets ≤4,096 → `low`, ≤16,384 → `medium`, else `high`; `none`, `minimal` and 0 emit nothing | A | `effort-approximated` |

| Other harnesses | `model: inherit` | U | `harness-unsupported` |
| Local `sub_agents` | One file per sub-agent, plus `Agent(<name>)` in the parent's `tools` | A | `delegation-approximated` |

| `max_iterations` | `maxTurns` (0 is omitted) | A | `max-iterations-approximated` |
| `readonly` | Read-only file tools, no `Bash`, and `disallowedTools: Write, Edit, NotebookEdit` | A | `readonly-approximated` |
| `filesystem` toolset | `Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep` (`Read, Glob, Grep` when read-only); `deny_list` entries become `Read(<path>/**)` and `Edit(<path>/**)` deny rules with `--settings` | A | `toolset-approximated`, `permission-approximated` |
| `filesystem` `allow_list` | Not emitted: it limits docker-agent's file tools to those directories, and Claude Code cannot confine an agent's tools to paths. It never becomes an allow rule. Add deny rules for paths the agent must not reach | U | `restriction-unsupported` (warning) |
| `shell` | `Bash` | E | — |
| `fetch` | `WebFetch`; `blocked_domains` become `WebFetch(domain:…)` deny rules with `--settings` (a bare host also denies `*.<host>`; CIDR ranges are dropped) | E/A | `permission-approximated` |
| `fetch` `allowed_domains` | Not emitted: Claude rules cannot allow `WebFetch` for some domains only, and the list never becomes allow rules | U | `restriction-unsupported` (warning) |
| `todo`, `tasks` | `TaskCreate, TaskGet, TaskList, TaskUpdate` | A | `toolset-approximated` |
| `memory` | `memory: project` | A | `toolset-approximated` |

| Toolset `tools` filter on built-in toolsets | The matching Claude tools only | A | `tool-filter` |
| `mcp` with `command` | With `--mcp inline`, an inline `mcpServers` entry `{type: stdio, command, args, env}`; with `--mcp project`, a `.mcp.json` server and its name in `mcpServers`; `mcp__<server>__<tool>` per `tools` entry, else `mcp__<server>__*`. `${env.X}` → `${X}`, `${env.X \|\| 'd'}` → `${X:-d}`, `${X}` stays. With the default `--mcp none`, nothing | E/A | `executes-command`, `mcp-not-generated`, `template-literal` for other expressions |
| `mcp` with `remote` | `type: http` (streamable) or `sse`, `url`, `headers`, and `oauth.clientId`/`callbackPort` | E | `mcp-oauth-unsupported` for `clientSecret`, `scopes`, `callbackRedirectURL` |
| `mcp` with `ref: docker:<name>` | stdio `docker mcp gateway run --servers <name>` | A | `mcp-docker-gateway`, `executes-command` |
| `mcp` `ref` to an `mcps` definition | The definition merged with the toolset's own fields, named after the definition | E | — |
| MCP `version`, `working_dir`, `lifecycle`, `allow_private_ips`, `config`; toolset `instruction`, `defer`, `timeout`, `env` on non-MCP toolsets, and similar | Not emitted | U | `toolset-field-unsupported` (info) |
| `mcp_catalog`, `script`, `api`, `openapi`, `a2a`, `rag`, `webhook`, `scheduler`, `lsp`, `file`, `git` and every other toolset | Not emitted | U | `toolset-unsupported` |
| No toolset with a Claude tool and no local sub-agent | `tools: []` and `disallowedTools` naming `Bash, Write, Edit, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, WebSearch`, so the Claude agent gets no tools, like a docker-agent agent without toolsets, instead of inheriting every tool (the `disallowedTools` guard covers Claude Code versions that read an empty list as omitted). `tools` is always emitted | E | `tools-none` (info) |
| `commands` and `use_commands` (with `--commands`) | `.claude/skills/<command>/SKILL.md` with `disable-model-invocation: true`; `${args[i]}` → `$i`, `${args}` and `${args.join(" ")}` → `$ARGUMENTS`. A command with `agent` becomes `context: fork` + `agent: <name>` (body `$ARGUMENTS` without an instruction). Identical commands of several agents share one skill; different ones are prefixed with their agent | A | `command-approximated`, `command-renamed`, `template-literal`, `description-synthesized` |
| `url` commands | Not emitted | U | `command-unsupported` |
| `commands` without `--commands` | Not emitted | U | `commands-not-generated` (info) |
| `skills` names | `skills:` frontmatter (preloaded) | A | `skills-approximated` |
| `skills: true/false`, skill sources, inline skills | Not emitted | A/U | `skills-approximated` (info), `skills-unsupported` |
| `hooks` events with a Claude equivalent: `pre_tool_use`, `post_tool_use`, `permission_request`, `session_start`, `user_prompt_submit`, `session_end`, `pre_compact`/`before_compaction`, `after_compaction`, `subagent_stop`, `stop`, `notification`, `worktree_create` (with `--hooks`) | Frontmatter `hooks` with `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, …; `command` hooks keep `command` and `timeout` (`args` only parameterize docker-agent's builtin hooks and are dropped); tool matchers translate tool names (`shell` → `Bash`, `edit_file` → `Edit`, …) | A | `executes-command`, `hook-approximated`, `hook-matcher-approximated`, `hook-field-unsupported` |
| `hooks` without `--hooks` | Not emitted | U | `hooks-not-generated` (info) |
| Other hook events, `builtin` and `model` hooks | Not emitted | U | `hook-unsupported` |
| Top-level `permissions` (with `--settings`) | `.claude/settings.json` rules: `shell:cmd=<glob>` → `Bash(<glob>)`; `mcp:<server>:<tool>` → `mcp__<generated server>__<tool>` (`*` → `mcp__<generated server>`), only for servers this run generates; built-in tool names and globs → the Claude tool of the same reach (`read_file` → `Read`, `list_directory` → `Glob`, `search_files_content` → `Grep`, `write_file` → `Write`, `edit_file` → `Edit`, `shell` → `Bash`, `fetch` → `WebFetch`, `user_prompt` → `AskUserQuestion`, todo and task tools → `Task*`). Tools without such a rule (`create_directory`, `remove_directory`, task dependencies and deletions, `think`, MCP tools without the `mcp:` prefix) and argument conditions other than `shell:cmd=` are never widened to a broader rule | A | `permission-approximated`, `permission-unsupported` (a warning when a deny or ask pattern is lost), `grants-permission`, `broad-permission` |
| Top-level `permissions` without `--settings` | Not emitted | U | `permissions-not-generated` (info) |
| `fallback`, compaction, `cache`, `budgets`, `safety`, `redact_secrets`, `structured_output`, history and token limits | Not emitted | U | `setting-unsupported` (info) |
| Top-level `metadata`, `runtime`, `budget`, `budgets`, `flavors`, `evaluators`, `providers` | Not emitted | U | `setting-unsupported` (info) |

Diagnostics are reported once per definition file, pointer, code and message, so a shared model or toolset appears once. A docker-agent → Claude → docker-agent round trip is lossy by design: edit the definition, never the generated file.

## Importing Claude agents

`agents import --from claude` reverses the mapping where it can. Every diagnostic `pointer` refers to the Claude agent's frontmatter and `path` names the Markdown file.

| Claude Code | docker-agent | Fidelity | Diagnostic codes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Agent name; characters other than letters, digits, `-` and `_` become `-` | E | `name-sanitized` |
| `description`, body | `description`, `instruction` | E | — |
| `model: claude-…` | `anthropic/claude-…` | E | — |

## Errors

| Code | Exit | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `INVALID_AGENT_DEFINITION` | 2 | A definition fails validation (`details.files[].diagnostics`), a create or import would leave the file invalid, or generation has error diagnostics such as colliding names or `broad-permission` (`details.diagnostics`) |
| `AGENT_NOT_FOUND` | 3 | `inspect <file>#<agent>` or `generate --agent` names an agent no definition defines |
| `AGENT_EXISTS` | 2 | `create` or `import` names an agent the target file already defines |
| `AGENT_MERGE_CONFLICT` | 2 | `generate` would replace an MCP server or main agent in `.mcp.json` or `.claude/settings.json` that Forge did not write (`details.diagnostics`) |
| `AGENT_DRIFT` | 5 | `generate --check` found missing, changed, hand-edited or stale outputs |

Commands also report `NOT_FOUND`, `CONFLICT` (stale `--if-match`, or regenerating existing outputs without approved revisions), `INVALID_NAME`, `INVALID_PATH` (a create or import file outside the definitions folder), `INVALID_YAML`, `INVALID_CLAUDE_AGENT` (an imported agent or generated frontmatter), `INVALID_CLAUDE_SETTINGS` (an unparsable `.mcp.json` or `.claude/settings.json` to merge into, or an invalid `.claude/forge-generated.json`), `INVALID_GENERATION_PLAN` and `INVALID_GENERATION_REVISIONS`; see the [error catalog](errors.md).

## Limits

- Forge validates and generates; it does not run docker-agent agents, resolve OCI references, expand templates or check that models, MCP servers or credentials exist.
- HCL definitions and flavors are not read; generation uses the file as written.
- Generated agents and skills target Claude Code's project scope (`.claude/` in the command scope). Structural validation does not prove that Claude Code accepts every generated hook, permission rule or MCP server at runtime, or that it reads `tools: []` as no tools in every version (hence the `disallowedTools` guard).
