# Develop and verify a change

[Documentation](../index.md) · How-to guide

Use Node >=22.12, npm and GNU tar (needed by archive tests and release packaging). `npm ci` installs locked development dependencies, including Oxlint 1.86.0 and the Rust-based fallow 3.31.0 analyzer. Their platform-specific native binaries are development tools; installation requires a supported OS/architecture and npm optional dependencies. Do not use `--omit=optional`. npm 11 runs a dependency's install script only when `package.json` `allowScripts` approves it: the project approves esbuild's (it verifies its platform binary) and denies fsevents' (macOS uses the prebuilt binary), so `npm ci` reports no unreviewed scripts; npm 10 ignores the field. Generated projects carry the same entries. No Rust toolchain is needed for the prebuilt npm packages. Runtime libraries include Commander for CLI parsing, Zod for configuration, unified/remark for Markdown structure, YAML for document codecs, and Day.js for template dates. Vite includes them in the runtime bundle; Node standard-library modules remain external. Vite writes the runtime bundle to `bin/forge-runtime.js`; packaging adds the small `bin/forge.js` launcher, which enables Node's compile cache (`module.enableCompileCache()`) before loading the bundle, so later invocations skip compiling it again; without the bundle it prints an `INVALID_SETUP` JSON error naming the missing file instead of a Node stack trace. Node keeps that cache in `node-compile-cache` under the operating system's temporary directory, never in the workspace; `NODE_DISABLE_COMPILE_CACHE=1` turns it off. The release runs in both ESM and CommonJS parent projects because `bin/package.json` sets `type: commonjs` for both files; keep the three files together. Packaging copies direct and transitive runtime dependency licenses and generates `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` from the lockfile.

```sh
cd src/the-forge
npm ci
# quick feedback while changing code
npm run check:fast
# all quality checks, a fresh bundle, and the complete test suite
npm run check
# full validation, then release archive and SHA-256 checksum
npm run release
```

Run npm from the Forge project directory `src/the-forge`; it owns `package.json`, the lockfile and `node_modules`. The workspace root has no npm toolchain. `npm test` expects the workspace `bin/forge.js` to have been built. After changing CLI source, run `npm run build` before focused bundle/integration tests; source-level unit tests can run directly. `npm run dev` watches and rebuilds the executable with Vite while retaining other bundle files; it does not refresh packaged documentation, SDK declarations, licenses, skills or configuration. `npm run build` refreshes the complete distribution. Use the full build before testing release behavior, distributing or committing artifacts.

The build writes into the workspace `bin/` that `config.distribution` in `package.json` names (`../../bin`, relative to the project). Vite, `scripts/package.mjs`, `scripts/release.mjs`, the showcase script and the test support module `tests/support/workspace.ts` all read that one setting, so no script assumes the repository layout implicitly.

## Develop the selected source project

The checkout's tracked `bin/config.json` uses `paths.projects: "src"`, its `src/the-forge/.forge/project.json` marker registers the Forge project, and tracked `bin/data/context.json` selects `the-forge`. Confirm scope from the workspace root before using the bundled CLI:

```sh
node bin/forge.js project current --json
node bin/forge.js project open the-forge
node bin/forge.js read src/main.ts --json
node bin/forge.js make entity SourceProbe --out src/domain/example --dry-run
```

These file paths resolve relative to the project root `src/the-forge`, the same way they resolve in any generated project: `read README.md` reads the project README, `read src/main.ts` the runtime entry, and `--out src/domain/<concern>` targets a source layer concern. `project close` explicitly returns file commands to the workspace root; reopen `the-forge` to resume project work. Setup and builds preserve the saved selection, including an intentional closed selection. Release packaging restores generic configuration and omits the checkout selection in the archive.

The project's `configs/quality/source.json` declares `sourceRoot: "src"` and `additionalRoots: ["docs/examples", "docs/templates"]`. Source inventory, lint and analysis include Forge source, `tests`, `scripts`, root configuration files and authored asset code. Sibling managed projects such as `src/forge-showcase` live outside the project directory, so they are never part of Forge's checks; run each project's own checks from its directory. This quality policy is independent of the CLI's selected project. Portable generated projects without this policy continue to use their ordinary `src` source root.

## Documentation vault check

The project's documentation is an Obsidian-compatible vault. The checkout's tracked workspace `bin/config.json` sets `plugins.settings.vault-check.ignore` to `src/README.md`, `tests/**` and `evals/fixtures/**`; the globs are relative to the selected project, so from the workspace root, with `the-forge` selected, `node bin/forge.js vault check --strict` passes. They match no vault file of `src/forge-showcase`, which stays fully checked when it is selected, and with no project selected they match nothing, so `project close` checks everything. `tests/vault-check/docs-vault.integration.test.ts` reads the same settings from `bin/config.json` and runs the check over the whole project in the full gate, and once more over `README.md`, `docs/**` and `skills/**`. Builds keep the checkout's `bin/config.json`; release archives replace it with the generic defaults. Three kinds of files stay outside the check on purpose: `src/README.md` and `tests/README.md` link folders (`[cli](cli/)`) for navigation on GitHub, which Obsidian cannot resolve; `tests/` holds fixture vaults whose links are broken deliberately; and `evals/fixtures/` is the [agent evaluation](evaluate-agents.md) vault, whose unresolved `[[Idea List]]` link and unlinked `Scratch.md` are what its tasks ask agents to repair. An error finding anywhere else is a real defect: fix the link rather than adding an exclusion.

## Showcase drift check

`src/forge-showcase` is a committed, fully generated example project; see [explore the showcase](explore-the-showcase.md). `npm run showcase:check` regenerates it into a temporary workspace through the current `bin/forge.js` and lists every differing path; it never modifies the checkout. It skips toolchain outputs and the self-ignoring metadata cache `.forge/cache`, which any command run with `--root src/forge-showcase` stores there. It is the last stage of `npm run check` and runs alone after the test suite: regeneration starts about 250 CLI processes, runs its read-only steps concurrently and took 70 to 100 seconds on a busy four-core machine, which inside the parallel test pool would compete with every other worker for the CPU. The end-to-end test `tests/showcase/showcase.e2e.test.ts` checks the committed project instead: it queries its Bases, validates its Canvas, checks UI and adapter drift through the CLI and confirms that the gate still ends with the drift check. When a change alters generated output, rebuild, run `npm run showcase`, review the showcase diff and commit it with the change. Forge's quality inventory excludes the showcase; run its own `npm ci` and `npm run check` from `src/forge-showcase` when its toolchain or generated code changes.

## Agent evaluation tasks

`evals/tasks/*.yaml` are agent tasks with fixtures and deterministic checks. `npm run eval` replays their reference commands, and `tests/evals/reference.e2e.test.ts` does the same inside `npm run check`, so a change that breaks a task's reference sequence or makes a check vacuous fails the gate. When a command's behavior or output changes, update the affected tasks; measure agents with the opt-in `claude` driver as described in [evaluate agents](evaluate-agents.md).

## Metadata benchmark

`npm run bench` measures the commands that load the metadata index on a deterministic synthetic vault, through the built `bin/forge.js`; run `npm run build` first. It is not part of `npm run check`. `scripts/bench/vault.mjs` writes 2,000 notes in 20 folders, 100 images and one Base into a temporary workspace. Every note has frontmatter with aliases, tags and a link property, wikilinks, heading and alias links, a URL-encoded relative Markdown link (unresolved unless it shares the folder), a missing link, inline tags, a block id, tasks and an embed. `scripts/bench/metadata.mjs` then runs `vault check`, `links unresolved`, `search details --tag t3` and `bases query bases/Notes.base --view Active`, each once cold (the workspace's `.forge/cache` removed) and `--runs` times warm (default 3, after an unmeasured `links unresolved` stored the cache), and prints one JSON report with wall and CPU times in milliseconds. Before the first run it waits out the cache's two-second racy window, so the stored stamps of the freshly generated notes are trusted. Each result counts `warmCacheRewrites`; a warm run that rewrote the cache was not warm, which fails the result and exits with code 1:

```sh
npm run bench
npm run bench -- --large                       # 4,000 notes and 500 images
npm run bench -- --notes 500 --attachments 20 --runs 5 --keep
npm run bench -- --forge /path/to/other/bin/forge.js
```

`--keep` leaves the generated workspace in place and reports its `root`, for profiling with `node --cpu-prof bin/forge.js --root <root> vault check`. Wall times depend on machine load, so compare two builds on the same machine, one after the other.

## Agent feedback loop

Read `AGENTS.md`, establish acceptance examples and inspect the affected boundary. After a focused edit, run the relevant behavioral test and `npm run check:fast`. This gate runs structure validation first, then Oxlint, fallow and the TypeScript compiler without rebuilding the distribution. Static analysis complements tests; a clean report does not prove business behavior or filesystem integrity. Analysis includes test entry points, so code referenced only by tests counts as used; this is not proof of production reachability.

| Stage | Purpose | Focused command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Structure | Test-pyramid labels/locations and Forge source layout | `npm run check:structure` |
| Lint | Correctness, source conventions and code-line limits | `npm run lint` |
| Analyze | Unused code/dependencies and architecture boundaries | `npm run analyze` |
| Typecheck | Strict TypeScript contracts in source and tests | `npm run typecheck` |
| Build | Bundle runtime dependencies, declarations and assets | `npm run build` |
| Test | Behavioral, integration and portable distribution checks | `npm test` |
| Showcase | The committed showcase regenerates without drift | `npm run showcase:check` |

`npm run check:structure`, `npm run lint` and `npm run analyze` save JSON diagnostic envelopes with `tool`, `ok` and `errors`, plus `scope` and the underlying tool `report` when available, to `.quality-reports/structure.json`, `.quality-reports/oxlint.json` and `.quality-reports/fallow.json` (ignored by Git). A failing stage prints the whole envelope; a passing stage prints only `tool`, `ok`, `errors`, the number of `files` in scope and the path of the saved `report`, which keeps CI logs short. fallow's policy detector is switched off (`policy-violation: off`) because the project configures no rule packs. Reports identify the configured scope; the wrappers reject mismatched file inventories; fallow also rejects an unexpected report version/schema or missing required checks so an accidentally empty scan cannot pass. When consuming the output programmatically, invoke the wrapper directly (`node scripts/quality/lint.mjs`, `node scripts/quality/analyze.mjs`) to avoid npm's script banner. Read the report from the command just executed; later stages may not have run after an earlier failure. A nonzero exit status requires investigation; an empty or malformed report is not evidence of success.

Fix the cause of each failure and rerun its stage before proceeding. Keep changes focused; do not suppress findings, widen analyzer entry points or delete tests just to make a command green. If a dynamic plugin contract creates a real false positive, document the specific contract and use the narrowest justified configuration. The plugin SDK is a public entry point even when the CLI itself does not import every SDK export.

After the targeted checks pass, run `npm run check` once as the final gate. It rebuilds before running the complete test suite, so CLI tests exercise current source. Review source and bundle diffs together and report the commands run, acceptance examples exercised, affected concerns/ranks and unresolved failures. Review evidence should distinguish source-level tests, filesystem/process integration, standalone distribution workflows and downstream framework verification. For generated projects, run that project's scripts from its directory; the Forge repository's passing checks do not validate downstream business code. See [project feedback](manage-projects.md).

## Verification

Tests are grouped by concern under `tests/<concern>/`: architecture, CLI, data sources, distribution, documentation, documents, evals, forms, generation, plugins, projects, quality, showcase, skills, templates, UI, workflows and workspace. The repository's `tests/README.md` indexes those boundaries. Keep helpers shared across concerns in `tests/support`; place concern-specific fixtures near their consumers. Directory grouping describes ownership; filename suffixes describe verification scope.

Every test has an explicit pyramid rank in its filename and runs in the matching named Vitest project:

| Layer | Filename | Scope | Focused command |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | `*.unit.test.ts` | Isolated domain/parser/codec behavior | `npm test -- --project unit` |
| Integration | `*.integration.test.ts` | Collaborating services, adapters and quality boundaries | `npm test -- --project integration` |
| End-to-end | `*.e2e.test.ts` | Bundled CLI and extracted-release workflows | `npm test -- --project e2e` |

Put most behavioral cases in focused unit tests, test real boundaries with integration tests, and keep end-to-end cases for complete workflows. Choose the layer by what a test exercises, including when splitting pure parser/graph assertions away from filesystem or lifecycle integration tests. A concern folder can contain multiple ranks. Run `npm run build` before tests that execute the bundle; the full `check` does this automatically.

`npm run lint` uses Oxlint's `max-lines` rule with `skipBlankLines` and `skipComments` to enforce **400 code-bearing lines per authored source file** and **450 per test file or test-support file under `tests/`**. Blank and comment-only lines are excluded; lines containing both code and comments count. The inventory covers authored JavaScript/TypeScript in the configured project `src`, `docs/examples` and `docs/templates`, plus `scripts`, `tests` and root configuration files. Generated `bin` artifacts are excluded. When approaching a limit, extract a cohesive responsibility or split tests by behavior; do not compress statements, remove useful comments or rename files just to evade a limit. Line-limit findings appear in `.quality-reports/oxlint.json`.

`npm run check:structure` checks test-pyramid suffixes, requires tests under `tests/`, and enforces Forge's `src/<layer>/<concern>/` layout. It saves `.quality-reports/structure.json` using the same diagnostic envelope as lint/analysis. Use `node scripts/quality/structure.mjs --source-layout forge` for JSON stdout without npm's banner. The generated-project copy runs without that switch and keeps its own scaffold layout. See the project's `src/README.md` for placement rules. The TypeScript gate uses the official `tsc` compiler for application source and an explicit inventory of all test/support files, including hidden paths and JavaScript with `allowJs`/`checkJs`. This avoids files being silently omitted by compiler globs. Passing Vitest execution alone does not replace type checking.

Vitest exercises Canvas invariants, YAML/frontmatter preservation, optimistic revisions, no-write previews, path and symlink rejection, batch collision preflight, event delivery/lifecycle, and the standalone JSON protocol. End-to-end tests copy the bundle to a temporary directory without `node_modules` and invoke it through Node. Every accepted attachment extension gets a binary round-trip test; these tests establish byte fidelity, not media codec validity. Tests also load an external runtime plugin from the copied bundle. An architecture test rejects infrastructure or Node imports in domain/application code.

Generated boilerplate must be reviewed and tested in its destination project. Domain scaffolds include generic identity/value validation; application scaffolds demonstrate dependency injection. They do not implement inferred business requirements.

## Adding behavior

1. Define the observable contract and acceptance cases, including errors.
2. Put invariants in domain code and orchestration in an application service with injected ports.
3. Implement adapters and register commands in the presentation catalog. Add a generator or runtime plugin when that is the appropriate extension point.
4. Cover meaningful behavior and integration boundaries. Update help, docs and relevant agent skills.
5. Diagnose and fix failed checks, rerun the failed stage, then run `npm run check`. Review the source and rebuilt artifact diff and commit both.

No global dependency container, Obsidian process or npm runtime installation is required. Prefer explicit collaborators and domain terms over generic helper layers.

## Platform matrix

GitHub Actions runs the full gate (`npm ci`, then `npm run check`, both in `src/the-forge`) for manual dispatches and for every pull request and push to `main` that touches the Forge project, the workspace `bin/` or the generated workflow itself. Pushes to other branches run only through their pull request, so each change runs the matrix once. The workflow is authored in `src/infrastructure/workflows/check/check.yml` and synchronized to `.github/workflows/the-forge--check.yml` by `node bin/forge.js workflows sync`; a separate guard workflow runs `workflows sync --check` on every pull request. See [workflows](../reference/workflows.md).

| Runner | Node | Additional steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ubuntu-latest` | 22.12.0, 24 | Verifies that the committed `bin/` matches the fresh build, then builds and uploads the release archive |
| `windows-latest` | 22.12.0, 24 | Runs steps in Git Bash and puts Git's GNU tar first on `PATH` |
| `macos-latest` | 22.12.0, 24 | Puts Homebrew's GNU tar (`gnubin`) first on `PATH` |

The committed bundle is the Linux build. Windows and macOS verify behavior, not identical bundle bytes. Workflow actions are pinned to full commit SHAs.

`.gitattributes` checks out text files with LF line endings on every platform, regardless of `core.autocrlf`, and marks media and archive types as binary. Revisions hash raw bytes, so a checkout that converted line endings would change every revision and break byte comparisons between packaged and source files.

Keep tests portable:

- Build expected OS paths with `node:path` (`join`, `basename`), and pass POSIX workspace paths (`notes/a.md`) to the CLI and repository ports.
- The CLI reports canonical roots (`realpath`). Canonicalize temporary directories before comparing them or running toolchains such as Vite in them, because macOS `/var` links to `/private/var` and Windows can report 8.3 short names. `tests/support/portable-cli.ts` already does this.
- Start npm through a shell (`exec('npm run ...')`). On Windows, npm is a `.cmd` shim that Node only starts through a shell.
- Use `'junction'` when linking `node_modules` into fixtures. Junctions need no symlink privilege on Windows, and other platforms ignore the type. Symlink-rejection tests still create real symlinks, which the Windows runners allow.
- Run `tar` with relative paths from a working directory. GNU tar reads `C:\...` as a remote host name.
- Pass `-c core.autocrlf=false` when a test lets Git write files. Git for Windows enables `core.autocrlf` globally and would write CRLF.
- Remove temporary directories that a terminated child process used with `rm(..., { maxRetries })`. Windows can keep the working directory busy (`EBUSY`) for a moment after termination.
- A child that closes its input early fails the parent's write with `EPIPE` on POSIX but `EOF` on Windows.
- Do not assume POSIX permission bits, signals or process groups. Windows reports writable files as `0o666`. Skip a test on `win32` only when the behavior it checks cannot exist there, and give the reason in a comment. The current skips are the Claude runtime signal and process-group cases; the installed-lifecycle fixture that executes a script through its shebang; the eval claude driver cases, which start a fake `claude` through its shebang and check that a timeout ends its process group; and the eval driver signal case, which checks that SIGINT to the driver ends the agent's process group. `tests/workspace/lock-recovery.integration.test.ts` runs its pid-reuse, live-holder and restart cases only on Linux (`it.runIf(linux)`): the lock records the process start time, pid namespace and boot id from `/proc`, which macOS and Windows do not have.
- macOS and Windows file systems are case-insensitive by default. Detect case sensitivity at runtime when a test depends on it, as `tests/workspace/portability.integration.test.ts` does.

`vitest.config.ts` gives each pyramid level explicit 30-second test and hook timeouts, because creating processes on Windows runners is much slower than on Linux. `npm test` adds no command-line overrides, so a focused `npx vitest run <file>` uses the same budgets as the full gate; `tests/quality/test-budgets.integration.test.ts` checks this. The portable CLI harness (`tests/support/portable-cli.ts`) starts every command asynchronously, so a long end-to-end test never blocks the test worker's event loop, and each call fails after 30 seconds instead of hanging.

For publishing a validated distribution archive, see [build a release](release.md).
