# Use the admin webview

[Documentation](../index.md) · How-to

Use the read-only admin view to inspect the workspace, project selection, installed plugins, contribution counts and runtime health while an agent works through the CLI. The complete `bin/` distribution includes the view; you do not need to install Vue, run npm or manage a separate web server to inspect it.

From the workspace root:

```sh
node bin/forge.js server status --json
node bin/forge.js server start --webview admin --json
```

Check that `ok` is `true` and open the returned `data.url` in a browser. The URL uses `127.0.0.1` and includes the local authentication token. Open the complete returned link, including its fragment. A default startup chooses an available port. Repeating the command reuses the workspace server, so it is safe for an agent to retrieve the launch link again.

Use the link from `server start --webview admin`; `server status` returns the generic JSON view catalog's URL. If a tab reports missing access, retrieve and open a fresh admin launch link with the same start command. The view removes the token from the address bar and keeps it in browser tab session storage; the cleaned address alone cannot authenticate a browser session that has no saved token.

The agent can offer to start this view when a visual overview would help. The CLI remains noninteractive: it prints one JSON response, does not open a browser and starts a background server only through an explicit `server start` invocation. `server status` alone never starts it.

The view refreshes every 15 seconds while its tab is visible and auto-refresh is enabled. Use its refresh control after CLI operations to request an update; the server may reuse a snapshot collected within the last three seconds. Configuration and plugin changes remain CLI/file workflows; the view offers no mutation controls. Runtime counts describe discovered contributions and availability, not a historical activity log or test results. If inspection reports unavailable state, read its warning and use the CLI's `config`, `project current` and `plugins` commands to diagnose it. A warning can mean that a displayed empty value could not be inspected; it does not prove that the underlying state is empty. The view reflects configured workspace plugins; passing `--no-plugins` to startup does not change its ongoing inspection policy.

To preview lifecycle changes or choose a port:

```sh
node bin/forge.js server start --webview admin --port 3000 --dry-run
node bin/forge.js server start --webview admin --port 3000
```

If a server is already running, startup reuses its existing port. To change that port, stop it first. A dry run never starts or stops a process. If workspace defaults enable dry runs, add `--no-dry-run` when applying the operation.

When finished:

```sh
node bin/forge.js server stop --json
node bin/forge.js server status --json
```

An open browser tab may show its last successful snapshot after shutdown or a failed refresh. Check the connection warning and last-updated time before treating displayed values as current. Start the server again and use its newly returned launch link to reconnect. Keep launch links private to the local session.

For a different workspace, place `--root <workspace>` before `server`; the currently selected project does not redirect server state. See [localhost server reference](../reference/server.md) for fields, lifecycle guarantees, errors and the independent API/webview boundary. The admin project's own README describes its Vue/Nuxt UI development toolchain and Playwright browser inspection/tests; the shipped view is always started and stopped through `node bin/forge.js server`.
