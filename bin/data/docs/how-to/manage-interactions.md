# Maintain shared interaction definitions

[Documentation](../index.md) · How-to

Use this guide when you have a component library and want to maintain reusable
browser behavior. Definitions live at workspace scope even when a project is
open. See [the schema reference](../reference/interactions.md) for supported
states, events and actions.

## Initialize and inspect

```sh
node bin/forge.js interactions init --dry-run
node bin/forge.js interactions init
node bin/forge.js interactions list
node bin/forge.js interactions create toggle-details --event click --dry-run
node bin/forge.js interactions create toggle-details --event click
node bin/forge.js interactions inspect toggle-details
node bin/forge.js interactions validate
```

Edit the created Markdown file to express the intended actions. Declare every
referenced state field in each component that attaches the interaction. Validate
the complete graph with `components validate`; validating the interaction
library alone cannot know the component's state or attached element type.

To edit a shared definition with guarded generic file commands, close an active
project first. Use `read` to obtain its revision, then `write`, `edit` or
`properties` with `--if-match`. Opening a project does not move shared libraries.

## Use the save, upload and download defaults

After initialization, inspect the shipped definitions before attaching them:

```sh
node bin/forge.js interactions inspect save
node bin/forge.js interactions inspect upload
node bin/forge.js interactions inspect download
```

Attach `save` to a form to store its named fields under `forge-form` in browser
local storage. Use `upload` on a form when you have a working endpoint, and
declare an `uploadUrl` string prop in the component. Attach `download` to a
`type: button` inside the form to export its current fields as `form-data.json`:

```yaml
props:
  uploadUrl:
    type: string
    required: true
root:
  tag: form
  interactions: [upload]
  children:
    - tag: input
      attrs:
        name: email
        type: email
        aria-label: Email
        required: true
    - tag: input
      attrs:
        name: attachment
        type: file
        aria-label: Attachment
    - tag: button
      attrs:
        type: submit
      text: Upload
    - tag: button
      attrs:
        type: button
      interactions: [download]
      text: Download JSON
```

Provide `uploadUrl` when composing or mounting this component, for example
`/api/contact`. Replace `[upload]` with `[save]` for local draft storage. Save and
download include file metadata; upload sends actual file contents as multipart
form data. Neither saved JSON nor a download restores selected files. Give
separate forms distinct storage keys by copying and editing the save definition.

In the consuming application, listen for `forge:save`, `forge:upload` and
`forge:download` to confirm completion, and `forge:interaction-error` to show
failure feedback. Test denied storage, failed requests and server validation as
well as the success path. See the [form action contract](../reference/interactions.md#reusable-form-actions)
for exact payloads and browser limits.

## Transfer and select libraries

```sh
node bin/forge.js interactions export --out exchange/interactions
node bin/forge.js interactions import --from exchange/interactions --library reviewed-interactions
node bin/forge.js components validate --interactions-library reviewed-interactions
node bin/forge.js make ui contact-request --framework react --interactions-library reviewed-interactions --dry-run
```

The last command assumes your component library already contains the
[contact-request example](../examples/interactions/components/contact-request.md)
and the selected interaction library contains its referenced definitions. Imports
and exports refuse existing destination files. Set `interactions`,
`interactionImports` and `interactionExports` under `plugins.settings.ui` in
`bin/config.json` to make custom locations the defaults.

## Regenerate after behavior changes

Run the same generation command and target you used originally, selecting the
same project and libraries. Review the proposed changes before authorizing an
overwrite:

```sh
node bin/forge.js make ui contact-request --framework react --plan-out interaction-review.json
node bin/forge.js make ui contact-request --framework react --revisions-from interaction-review.json
node bin/forge.js make ui contact-request --framework react --check
```

The review file is create-only; choose a new name for a later review. Inspect its
associated `outputs` in the planning response, including `currentContent` for
changed files. Revision-map keys remain workspace-relative; the map file itself
is read from the selected output scope. Add `--stories` consistently if stories
are part of the output set. A missing or changed generated output makes
`--check` exit with code 5.

Finally run the consuming project's framework compiler and behavior tests.
Exercise the actual browser events and emitted custom events, including keyboard
and invalid form input. Deterministic generation and drift checks do not replace
runtime validation.
