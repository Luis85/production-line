# Sync a backlog with Azure DevOps

[Documentation](../index.md) · How-to guide

Use this guide to keep the notes of a [product backlog](manage-backlog.md) and the work items of an Azure DevOps Boards project in sync in both directions. Fields changed on one side flow to the other; fields changed on both sides are reported as conflicts and stay untouched until you resolve them. Exact contracts are in the [backlog sync reference](../reference/backlog.md#sync-with-external-trackers), the [connectors reference](../reference/connectors.md) and the [Azure DevOps connector reference](../reference/connector-azure-devops.md).

## 1. Provide a token

Create a personal access token with **Work Items (Read & write)** scope in Azure DevOps and export it in the shell that runs Forge. Never put it in configuration or notes. Forge sends the variable named by the profile's `tokenEnv` to the profile's organization, so review both when you take over someone else's configuration:

```sh
export AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT='<your token>'
```

## 2. Add a connection profile

Add the connection to the workspace's `bin/config.json`. `iterationRoot` lets Iteration notes map to sprints; `process` selects the type and state defaults; `areaPath` is the area of notes without an `area` property:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "settings": {
      "connector": {
        "connections": {
          "contoso": { "platform": "azure-devops", "organization": "https://dev.azure.com/contoso", "project": "Trailhead", "process": "agile", "iterationRoot": "Trailhead" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Check it, then probe the project with the token:

```sh
node bin/forge.js connectors list
node bin/forge.js connectors inspect contoso
node bin/forge.js connectors test contoso
```

`list` shows `valid`, `tokenSet` and `warnings` (for example an organization host that is not Azure DevOps Services); `inspect` shows the resolved type and state mappings. Adjust `mappings.states` when your backlog uses other state names than the defaults.

## 3. Bind a view

Add `connection: contoso` to the `product-backlog` view whose items should sync, or add a second view with its own filter for just those items. Several bound views can sync different item sets to different connections:

```yaml
  - type: product-backlog
    name: Contoso sync
    filters:
      and:
        - file.inFolder("docs/backlog/requirements")
    stateProperty: note.status
    priorityProperty: note.priority
    iterationProperty: note.iteration
    connection: contoso
```

## 4. Preview and push

```sh
node bin/forge.js backlog sync --dry-run
node bin/forge.js backlog sync
```

The dry run reads Azure DevOps but writes nothing; it lists the work items it would create, parents first. The real run creates them with their parent links, writes each note's `azure-devops` link property (open it in Obsidian to jump to the work item) and records the sync state in `.forge/sync/contoso.json`. Values Azure DevOps fills in on its own, such as the initial state `New` or a default priority, are pulled into the notes in the same run. With `dependsOnProperty: note.dependsOn` bound in the view, each note's `dependsOn` list becomes the work item's predecessor links (and links added or removed in Azure DevOps come back into the list), once every note it names is synced on the same connection.

Commit `.forge/sync/contoso.json` with the notes so every clone shares the sync base. Without it (a fresh clone, a deleted file), Forge relinks notes by their link property, and with no base it cannot tell which side changed: every field that differs between a note and its work item is reported as a conflict, and nothing is overwritten on either side. Resolve those conflicts once with `backlog sync resolve`; from then on the sync has a base again. Do not copy a note together with its link property: the copy is skipped as `duplicate-link` and never takes over the original's work item.

The note body becomes the work item's description, including embeds and wikilinks; Obsidian `%%comments%%` stay private and are never sent. Azure DevOps does not say on reads whether a description is Markdown, so a description edited in Azure DevOps is usually not pulled: the sync skips it (`remote-format-unknown`) and keeps the work item's text safe until you settle it with `backlog sync resolve <item> --take local|remote --field description`.

## 5. Keep in sync

Run `backlog sync` whenever you want both sides aligned; `backlog sync status` shows what would change without writing. Use `--direction push` or `--direction pull` to sync one way only, and `--view` to sync one view. Only one sync of a connection runs at a time, in any scope: a second one fails with `WORKSPACE_BUSY` naming `.forge/sync/contoso.lock` at the workspace root. Ctrl-C stops a sync at its next safe point with `SYNC_INTERRUPTED` and releases the lock; a sync that was killed leaves its lock behind, and the next sync removes it with a warning once its process no longer runs. Read `skipped` in the result: every entry has a `code` that says why a note or field was left alone.

When the same field changed in the note and in Azure DevOps, the sync reports it under `conflicts` with both values and leaves both sides alone. Settle it:

```sh
node bin/forge.js backlog sync status
node bin/forge.js backlog sync resolve "Draft a trip" --take remote
node bin/forge.js backlog sync resolve "Draft a trip" --take local --field state
```

Rename and move notes with `move` or `rename` so links and the sync state follow. A note that no bound view of its connection returns any more is reported under `left` and is never deleted in Azure DevOps; remove or close its work item there yourself. If a sync stops part-way (for example because the token expired), run it again after fixing the cause: work items it already created are recorded and are not created twice.
